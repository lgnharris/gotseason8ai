We have lost people we love at each other's hands.
(DRAGON SCREECHING) JAIME LANNISTER: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead.
And I intend to stay amongst the living.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) DAENERYS TARGARYEN: I offer you a choice.
Bend the knee and join me, or refuse, and die.
(MEN YELLING) She is here to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms.
The North is one of those seven kingdoms.
JON SHOW: The Night King's army grows larger by the day.
(YELLING) We need allies.
Powerful allies.
(WIGHT SCREECHES) CERSEI LANNISTER: The monsters are real.
Dragons, White Walkers, Dothraki screamers Let the monsters kill each other.
We will deal with whatever is left.
(MUSIC INTENSIFIES) DAENERYS: We are going to destroy the Night King and his army, and we'll do it together.
SANSA STARK: He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen.
He's bent the knee.
BRANDON STARK: He needs to know the truth.
Jon isn't really my father's son.
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.
We need to tell him.
JON SNOW: The same thing is coming for all of us And it is here.

At least your balls won't freeze off.
VARYS: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes.
Why is that? Because I have balls, and you don't.
I warned you.
Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
[DRAGON ROARS] [PEOPLE CLAMORING] [] [DRAGONS ROARING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [HORSES NEIGHING] [ROARS] [] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Look at you.
[SNIFFLES] You're a man.
Almost.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - JON: Where's Arya? - Lurking somewhere.
JON: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.
Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark.
The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.
Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.
We don't have time for all this.
The Night King has your dragon.
He's one of them now.
The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.
[] SANSA: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell.
Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive? We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.
And my lord.
And my queen.
Sorry.
SANSA: You'll have as many as we can spare.
Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well.
There's no sense in manning the castles anymore.
We make our stand here.
At once, Your Grace.
"Your Grace.
" But you're not.
Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a I'm not sure what you are now.
- [PEOPLE MURMURING] - LYANNA: A lord? Nothing at all? - It's not important.
- LYANNA: Not important? We named you King in the North.
[PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] MAN: King of the North! You did, my lady.
It was the honor of my life.
I'll always be grateful for your faith.
But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die.
I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us.
I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North.
I chose the North.
[PEOPLE MURMURING] If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank.
He risked his life to show us the threat is real.
Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen.
We have brought two full-grown dragons.
And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.
[PEOPLE GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past.
But we must fight together now or die.
May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons.
What do dragons eat, anyway? Whatever they want.
[HORSE NEIGHS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, careful, lads.
We need every last bit of it.
MAN 1: Sorry 'bout that.
Are these the last of the wagons? MAN 2: Aye.
GENDRY: All right, let's get it all to the forges.
My lord.
My lady.
My lady.
The Lady of Winterfell.
Has a nice ring to it.
So does Hand of the Queen.
Depending on the queen, I suppose.
Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding.
- Miserable affair.
- It had its moments.
Apologies for leaving like that.
Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.
We both survived.
Many underestimated you.
Most of them are dead now.
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north.
You have every right to be fearful of my sister.
No one fears her more than I do.
- But I promise, you'll be safe - Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you? She did.
And you believed her? She has something to live for now.
I believe she wants to survive.
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
[] ARYA: You used to be taller.
JON: How did you sneak up on me? How did you survive a knife through the heart? I didn't.
[CHUCKLES] - [SIGHS] - [SCOFFS] You still have it.
Needle.
Have you ever used it? Once or twice.
[CHUCKLES] Valyrian steel.
Jealous? [SCOFFS] Too heavy for me.
Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.
She doesn't like your queen, does she? Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
She's the smartest person I've ever met.
Now you're defending her? [CHUCKLES] You? I'm defending our family.
So is she.
[SOFTLY] Yeah.
[NORMALLY] I'm her family too.
[] Don't forget that.
Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news.
The dead have broken through the Wall.
Good.
[] Why don't you just get it over with and kill me? [SIGHS] But we're family.
The last Greyjoys left in the world.
[GRUNTS SOFTLY] The last ones with balls anyway.
[CHUCKLES] If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm? [SIGHS] I've got a crew full of mutes.
[SIGHS] It gets lonely at sea.
Are we in King's Landing? Mm.
You picked the losing side.
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
[FOOTSTEPS LEAVING] [PANTING] [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES] CERSEI: Twenty-thousand men, is it? Yes, Your Grace.
A few died in transit.
They cheated at dice.
Or maybe I cheated.
Someone cheated.
They weren't good fighters.
You won't miss them.
- Horses? - Two thousand.
And elephants? HARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.
That's disappointing.
I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
HARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.
In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.
We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.
EURON: Am I most welcome here? You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
EURON: Good.
As a true friend and an honored guest [GRUNTS] [WHISPERS] I was hoping we could talk in private.
After the war.
That was our agreement.
Wars sometimes last years.
You want a whore, buy one.
You want a queen earn her.
How? I've given her justice, an army and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection.
My heart is nearly broken.
You're insolent.
- I've executed men for less.
- They were lesser men.
[] [CHUCKLES] [DOOR OPENS] DIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
CRAYA: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
- DIRAH: Archie, was it? - And William.
- Tall handsome William? - Yeah, tall handsome William.
They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
- Did you? - BRONN: Nearly killed it.
That's brave.
[MOANING SOFTLY] [BRONN SIGHS] - CRAYA: That boy Eddie - DIRAH: The ginger? That's him.
Came back with his face burnt right off.
He's got no eyelids now.
How does he sleep with no eyelids? All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now? QYBURN: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
You're kidding me.
Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.
Sorry, ladies.
Another time perhaps.
You ever get lonely, I am partial to older gentlemen.
Poor girl.
The pox will take her within the year.
[COUGHS] - Which girl? - QYBURN: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them.
Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.
That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.
When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold.
Several chests of it, in fact.
Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.
So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.
If it's the Dragon Queen she's after She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
Yeah, well, good luck with that.
Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures.
But in the event that they do [] She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
That fucking family.
QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.
What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers? [] [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES] [SIGHS] I wanted those elephants.
[EURON SIGHS] So how do I compare to the fat king? You're insulting my late husband? Are you offended? Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.
And the Kingslayer? You enjoy risking your neck, don't you? [CHUCKLES] Life is boring.
You're not boring, I'll give you that.
[SIGHS] Do I please the queen? You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.
[WHISPERS] I like that.
[CHUCKLES] [NORMALLY] But now I want to be alone.
[SIGHS SOFTLY] [SOFTLY] I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
[DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [BOW STRING CREAKS] [MEN GRUNTING] - [FLESH SQUELCHES] - [GASPS] [PANTING] [GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNT] [] YARA: Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.
We can take our home back.
Daenerys went north.
Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North.
Somewhere the dead can't go.
[MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] You're my queen.
I go where you command.
You want to go to Winterfell.
To fight for the Starks.
Go.
What is dead may never die.
What is dead may never die.
But kill the bastards anyway.
[] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] WOLKAN: Welcome back, my lady.
If you'd follow me VARYS: The Karstarks.
TYRION: One of the better sigils.
Beats an onion, anyway.
Can't argue with that.
Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield.
Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.
TYRION: And our queen is grateful.
Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point.
The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her.
They don't know her.
The Free Folk don't know her.
I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats.
You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
A proposal is what I'm proposing.
On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man? TYRION: They do make a handsome couple.
VARYS: You overestimate our influence.
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
I'm not that old.
Not as old as him.
[CHUCKLES] Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
Of course she does.
Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.
TYRION: What is that? Nothing lasts.
MAN: Hey! [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Your sister doesn't like me.
She doesn't know you.
If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.
She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen.
If she can't respect me [MAN SPEAKS DOTHRAKI INDISTINCTLY] [IN DOTHRAKI] [IN DOTHRAKI] What's the matter? The dragons are barely eating.
[DRAGONS GROWLING SOFTLY] JON: What's wrong with them? They don't like the North.
Go on.
I don't know how to ride a dragon.
Nobody does.
Until they ride a dragon.
What if he doesn't want me to? Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.
[SCOFFS] [GRUNTS] What do I hold onto? Whatever you can.
- [DRAGON CHITTERS] - [JON GRUNTS] [] [GRUNTS] [JON YELPS] [YELLS] JON: Aah! [] [GRUNTS] [WIND WHISTLING] You've completely ruined horses for me.
[LAUGHS] We could stay a thousand years no one would find us.
We'd be pretty old.
[CHUCKLES] [] It's cold up here for a southern girl.
So keep your queen warm.
[DROGON GROWLS SOFTLY] Don't be afraid.
[EXHALES SHARPLY] MAN 1: That's good.
[MAN 1 SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [HAMMER CLANKING] - MAN 2: Gendry? - MAN 3: He's here.
It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
You're saying you're good, is that it? I'm just saying it's a tricky material to You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers.
- Which one are you? - ARYA: Leave him be.
I heard you were here.
[] You left me to die.
First I robbed you.
You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.
That was a nice ax you made for him.
You've gotten better.
Yeah, thanks.
So have you.
I mean, you look good.
Thanks.
So do you.
It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.
Stay close to that forge, then.
- Is that a command, Lady Stark? - Don't call me that.
As you wish, milady.
[MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [CHUCKLES] ARYA: Here's my wish.
Can you make it? What do you need something like this for? Can you make it or not? You already have a sword.
What's that? It's Valyrian steel.
I always knew you were just another rich girl.
[MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] You don't know any other rich girls.
[KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in.
[DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.
"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.
" Isn't that what he said? SANSA: "I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.
"The King in the North.
" I told you we needed allies.
SANSA: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
I never wanted a crown.
All I wanted was to protect the North.
I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.
And a Targaryen queen.
[SIGHS] Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa.
Twice.
You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter.
Without her, we don't stand a chance.
[SIGHS] Do you have any faith in me at all? You know I do.
She'll be a good queen.
For all of us.
She's not her father.
[SIGHS] No, she's much prettier.
[SCOFFS] Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her? [DOOR OPENS] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [CLEARS THROAT] Oh! So you're the man? Um Which man am I, Your Grace? The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
They could, they just wouldn't.
DAENERYS: I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne.
A great service merits a great reward.
SAMWELL: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Well, there must be something I could give you.
If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.
For what crime? Um I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.
And also a sword.
- From the Citadel? - SAMWELL: From my family.
It's been in House Tarly for generations.
It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.
Not Randyll Tarly? You know him? I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee.
[] DAENERYS: He refused.
[GULPS] Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.
Your brother stood with your father.
[BREATHING SHAKILY] Hm.
Thank you, Your Grace.
For telling me.

[DOOR CLOSES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SNIFFLES] [HORSE NEIGHS] [WHIMPERS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] SAMWELL: What are you doing out here? Waiting, for an old friend.
It's time to tell Jon the truth.
No, no.
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him? I'm not his brother.
He trusts you more than anyone.
Now's the time.
[JON SIGHS] [MAN GRUNTING, THUDS] [MAN GROANING] JON: Sam? I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.
- Were you hiding from me? - Of course not.
What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already? What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right? - She's good.
- Little Sam? Don't you know? Know what? Daenerys she executed my father and brother.
They were her prisoners.
She didn't tell you.
I'm so sorry.
We need to end this war.
Would you have done it? Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.
SAMWELL: You've also spared men.
Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
I wasn't a king.
But you were.
You've always been.
I gave up my crown, Sam.
I bent the knee.
I'm not King in the North anymore.
I'm not talking about the King in the North.
I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
[] Bran and I worked it out.
I had a High Septon's diary.
Bran had whatever Bran has.
What are you talking about? Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
[EXHALES SHARPLY] SAMWELL: And your father your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen.
You've never been a bastard.
You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne.
I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.
You're saying he lied to me all my life.
No.
Your father Well, Ned Stark.
He promised your mother he'd always protect you.
And he did.
Robert would have murdered you if he knew.
You're the true king.
Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.
[BREATHING SHAKILY] - Daenerys is our queen.
- SAMWELL: She shouldn't be.
- That's treason.
- It's the truth.
You gave up your crown to save your people.
Would she do the same? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [] [FOOTSTEPS GROWING LOUDER] [ALL SCREAMING] Stay back, he's got blue eyes! I've always had blue eyes! [SIGHING] [GRUNTS] Did you find anyone? [] EDD: The Umber boy.

From the Night King.
His army's between us and Winterfell.
We're on foot.
We rode down from Castle Black.
We can double up on the horses.
If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.
We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first.

About all the things we would do to that man.
You never should have trusted Cersei.
You never should have either.

You've always been.
DAENERYS TARGARYEN: She doesn't need to be my friend.
But I am her queen.
TYRION LANNISTER: We must fight together now or die.
- The things I do for love.
- (BRAN STARK GASPS) [] DAENERYS: When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.
Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat.
Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
He told me other stories as well.
About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
Your sister pledged to send her army north.
She did.
I don't see an army.
I see one man, with one hand.
It appears your sister lied to me.
She lied to me as well.
She never had any intention of sending her army north.
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops.
The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for.
Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.
"We"? I promised to fight for the living.
I intend to keep that promise.
- Your Grace, I know my brother - Like you knew your sister? He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received.
Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth? Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.
SANSA: You're right.
We can't trust him.
He attacked my father in the streets.
He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.
JAIME: Do you want me to apologize? I won't.
We were at war.
Everything I did, I did for my house and my family.
I'd do it all again.
The things we do for love.
DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned your house and family now? JAIME: Because this goes beyond loyalty.
This is about survival.
You don't know me well, Your Grace.
But I know Ser Jaime.
He is a man of honor.
I was his captor once.
But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me.
And lost his hand because of it.
Without him, my lady, you would not be alive.
He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.
You vouch for him? BRIENNE: I do.
You would fight beside him? I would.
I trust you with my life.
If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.
What does the Warden of the North say about it? [SIGHS] We need every man we can get.
Very well.
[INHALES SHARPLY] [] Thank you, Your Grace.
[] Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all.
Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.
- I was a fool.
- Not for the first time.
Cersei still sits on the throne.
If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.
[WIND WHISTLING] I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.

[] [MEN GRUNTING] [METAL HISSES] [HAMMER CLANGING] [HISSING] Don't you have something better to do? You make my weapon yet? Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.

It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.
Are you going to be down in the crypt? - No, but - But you're a fighter.
I've done my share.
You've fought them? I did.
Some of them.
How many? A few.
That was enough.

Really bad.
"Really bad"? Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad.

And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or This is different.
This is This is death.

That's what they're like.
I know Death.

I'm sorry for what I did to you.
You weren't sorry then.
You were protecting your family.
I'm not that person anymore.
You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window.
And I would still be Brandon Stark.
- You're not? - BRAN: No.
I'm something else now.
[RAVEN CAWS] You're not angry at me.
I'm not angry at anyone.
Why didn't you tell them? You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
What about afterwards? How do you know there is an afterwards? [] [MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] SOLDIER 1: Next up.

TYRION: Well, here we are.
Yes, here we are.
Together again.
[MAN CLEARS THROAT] [SPITS] And the masses rejoice.
How do they feel about their new queen? She's your new queen too.
They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north.
They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
And she is? Different? TYRION: She is.
- You're sure about her? - I am.
She didn't seem sure about you.
It's hard to blame her.
I made a mistake common to clever people.
- I underestimated my opponents.
- Hmm.
Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her.
A chance for you both to start again.
And I believed her.
MAN: That stuff can go on the end.
Was she lying about the baby too? No, that part is real.
She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies.
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
She's fooled me more than anybody.
CHILD: No, he's right there.
What? She never fooled you.
You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] So [HORSE NEIGHS] we're going to die at Winterfell.
Not the death I would've chosen.
I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, - with a belly full of wine and - BOTH: a girl's mouth - around your cock.
- around my cock.
At least Cersei won't get to murder me.
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
[PEOPLE ARGUING] Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
MAN: You will see the Army of the Dead.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Good.
[MAN GRUNTING] [HOOFBEATS POUNDING] [THUDS] PODRICK: Good.

It's, uh It's good ground.
It is.
The rise, it should give us some advantage.
If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.
[SIGHING] Yes, I think you're right.
- What are you doing? - What? - I think you know.
- I truly don't.
We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me.
Not once.
You want me to insult you? - No! - Good.
I came to Winterfell because I'm not the fighter I used to be.
[] But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.
I better get back.
[DOOR OPENS] JORAH: Forgive me, khaleesi.
[DOOR CLOSES] Have you done something to offend me? JORAH: Many things.
Long ago and long forgiven.
But you did forgive, despite my failures.
When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.
When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
You made the right choice.
I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
I didn't.
His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen.
It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
[CHUCKLES] But the mind behind all those words He's made mistakes.
Serious mistakes.
As have we all.
He owns his and learns from them.
You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position? I am.
And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.
ROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.
SANSA: Keep them open for as long as you can.
There are still people coming in from the countryside.
Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.
I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before.
About Ser Jaime.
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.
I trust her more than anyone.
I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
Tyrion is a good man.
He was never anything but decent towards me.
I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be.
He never should have trusted Cersei.
You never should have either.
I thought he knew his sister.
Families are complicated.
Ours certainly have been.
SANSA: A sad thing to have in common.
DAENERYS: We have other things in common.
We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule.
And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.
And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another.
Why is that? Your brother.
He loves you, you know that.
That bothers you.
Men do stupid things for women.
They're easily manipulated.
All my life, I've known one goal: the Iron Throne.
Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours.
My war was against them.
Until I met Jon.
Now I'm here, half a world away, fighting Jon's war alongside him.
Tell me, who manipulated whom? [SCOFFS] I should have thanked you the moment you arrived.
That was a mistake.
I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him and I know he's true to his word.
He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.
Who was the first? Someone taller.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.
What happens then? I take the Iron Throne.
[] What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back.
And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again.
What about the North? WOLKAN: Apologies, my lady.
Your Grace What is it? [] THEON: My queen.
Your sister? She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here.
So she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.
But why aren't you with her? I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa if you'll have me.
[] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Milord, we're not soldiers.
You are now.
Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards.
Right outside these walls.
If I can live through that, you can live through this.
They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge.
Right that way.
Thank you.
GILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.
They're the safest place to be.
Through that archway right over there.
Thank you.
WOMAN 1: Hey, hey, who's next, lads? WOMAN 2: Thank you, sir.
Come back! TEELA: Which way should I go? [] Which way do you want to go? All the children will be going below when the time comes.
But both me brothers were soldiers.
I want to fight too.
That's good to hear.
I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there - to protect us.
- I'm sure a lot of people would.
All right.
I'll defend the crypt, then.
[HORN BLARES] MAN: Riders coming in! [] [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] My little crow.
I thought we'd lost you.
TORMUND: Almost.
MAN: Put them in the stables.
How did you find each other? We met up at the Last Hearth.
The dead got there first.
The Umbers? Fighting for the Night King now.
We had to travel around them to get here.
Whoever's not here now is with them.
How long do we have? Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
The big woman still here? [] JON: They're coming.
MAN: Next.
JON: We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
[MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] JON: But there are too many of them.
Far too many.
[HORSE NEIGHS] Our enemy doesn't tire.
Doesn't stop.
Doesn't feel.
We can't beat them in a straight fight.
JAIME: So, what can we do? The Night King made them all.
They follow his command.
If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
If that's true, he'll never expose himself.
BRAN: Yes, he will.
He'll come for me.
He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.
Why? What does he want? An endless night.
He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.
SAMWELL: That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting.
Being forgotten.
If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore.
Just animals.
Your memories don't come from books.
Your stories aren't just stories.
If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.
How will he find you? His mark is on me.
He always knows where I am.
JON: We'll put you in the crypt, - where it's safest.
- BRAN: No.
We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all.
I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
SANSA: You want us to use you as bait? We're not leaving you alone out there.
He won't be.
I'll stay with him.
With the Ironborn.
I took this castle from you.
Let me defend you now.
We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
TYRION: When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.
Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own.
You'll be in the crypt.
Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again.
Alongside the men and women risking their lives.
There are thousands of them and only one of you.
You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them.
You're here because of your mind.
If we survive, I'll need it.
The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran.
We need to be near him.
Not too near, or the Night King won't come.
But close enough to pursue him when he does.
Dragonfire will stop him? I don't know.
No one's ever tried.
We're all going to die.
But at least we die together.
Let's get some rest.
Your Grace.
[DOOR CLOSES] TYRION: Do you need help? No.
You've had a strange journey.
Stranger than most.
I'd like to hear about it.
It's a long story.
If only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MISSANDEI: Hello.
GREY WORM: When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here.
I am loyal to my queen.
I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won [WHISPERS] do you want to grow old in this place? [] [NORMALLY] Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see? Naath.
I'd like to see the beaches again.
Then I will take you there.
My people are peaceful.
We cannot protect ourselves.
My people are not peaceful.
We will protect you.
[MEN GRUNT] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Yes, sir.
Have you told her yet? No.
Mm-hmm.
Being careful.
Biding your time.
Waiting for the perfect And now our watch begins.
Gilly? Little Sam? They'll be safe down in the crypt.
If you want to join them To protect them.
Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker.
- I've killed Thenns.
- Thenn.
I've saved Gilly more than once.
I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men.
You need me out there.
Well, if that's what it's come to, - we really are fucked.
- Well, calling you "fucked" wouldn't be strictly accurate.
[CHUCKLES] Samwell Tarly.
Slayer of White Walkers.
Lover of Ladies.
As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
[SIGHS] Think back to where we started.
[] Us, Grenn, Pyp.
Now it's just us three.
Last man left, burn the rest of us.
TYRION: I wish Father were here.
I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
[SNORTS] That would be something to see.
[WIND WHISTLING] TYRION: I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.
JAIME: Mm.
You were a golden lion.
I was a drunken whoremonger.
It was all so simple.
It wasn't so simple.
I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
I was speaking in relative terms.
- Do you miss it? - Of course I miss it.
Well, my golden-lion days are done, but whoremongering is still an option for you.
[SIGHS] It's not.
Things would be easier if it were.
The perils of self-betterment.
[DOOR OPENS] Oh! My lady.
BRIENNE: Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.
We were just looking for somewhere warm to To contemplate your imminent death.
You've come to the right place.
You want some of this piss? It's not bad.
- It's not good either.
- Thank you, milord.
I don't think that's wise.
The battle might start at any moment.
Half cup.
- And you? - BRIENNE: No, thank you.
I should try and get some sleep.
JAIME: You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
All right.
Just a bit.
DAVOS: Well, what do we have here? Ser Davos, join us.
No, not for me, thanks.
Came here for this.
[SIGHS] I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
It could be our last night in this world, you know.
Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.
[STAMMERING] Here fighting with us.
Glad you survived Eastwatch.
Would you like a drink? Brought my own.
They call you "King Killer.
" I'm sure someone does.
They call me "Giantsbane.
" Want to know why? I killed a giant when I was 10.
Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months.
Thought I was her baby.
That's how I got so strong.
Giant's milk.
[GULPING NOISILY] Mm.
Maybe I will have that drink.
[TORMUND GRUNTS] [SIGHS] You never used to shut up.
Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
Guess I've changed.
What are you doing up here? What's it look like? No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood.
You went beyond the Wall with Jon.
You're here now.
Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself? I fought for you, didn't I? Oh, for fuck's sake.
May as well be at a bloody wedding.
My lady.
It's good to see you again.
I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
Was he on your list? For a little while.
That's all right.
The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same.
This is his moment.
- When light - Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon.
Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.
[CHUCKLES] Where are you going? I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
[] [GRUNTS] [BOWSTRING CREAKS] ARYA: That for me? This'll work.
Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell.
Took the long road, but What did the Red Woman want with you? She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
Why your blood? I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
I didn't know until she told me.
Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.
Was that your first time? No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.
Your first time with a woman.
GENDRY: What? I I didn't I wasn't with her.
Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing? - [SCOFFS] - Or after? [STAMMERS INDISTINCTLY] - You don't remember? - [SCOFFS] - Yes, I was.
- One? Two? - Twenty? - Well, I didn't keep count.
Yes, you did.
[SIGHS] Three.
We're probably going to die soon.
I want to know what it's like before that happens.
Arya, I [INHALES SHARPLY] [BOTH CHUCKLE] [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS] I'm not the Red Woman.
Take your own bloody pants off.
[WIND WHISTLING] It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another.
And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it.
Together.
At least we'll die with honor.
I think we might live.
- [CHUCKLES] - [SNORTS] [DAVOS LAUGHS] I I do.
How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth.
Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
All without a shred - of combat ability.
- Mm.
Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.
Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth.
Defeated the Hound in Pardon me, Lady Brienne.
TORMUND: She's not a ser? You're not a knight? Women can't be knights.
- Why not? - Tradition.
Fuck tradition.
I don't even want to be a knight.
TORMUND: I'm no king.
But if I were, I'd knight you 10 times over.
JAIME: You don't need a king.
Any knight can make another knight.
[CUP THUMPS] I'll prove it.
[SWORD RINGS] Kneel, Lady Brienne.
[SCOFFS] JAIME: Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
[] In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.
In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.
In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.
Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.
[ALL CLAPPING] TYRION: Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms! JORAH: We have all we need to win this war.
LYANNA: I have trained my men, women and children.
I have fought before.
I can fight again.
JORAH: Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.
LYANNA: I don't need you to remind me of that.
You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting I will not hide underground.
I pledged to fight for the North, - and I will fight.
- MAN 1: I'm meant to relieve you.
- You got it? - MAN 2: Yeah, I got it.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to It's all right.
We're done here.
I wish you good fortune, cousin.
Thank you, my lady.
- My lady.
- My lady.
[CLEARS THROAT] What have you got there? It's called Heartsbane.
It's my family sword.
You still have a family.
Yes.
And I'd love to defend them with it.
But I can't really hold it upright.
Your father, he taught me how to be a man.
How to do what's right.
This is right.
It's Valyrian steel.
I'd be honored if you'd take it.
I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
I'll see you when it's through.
I hope we win.
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.
We're out of wine.
How about a song? One of you must know one.
Ser Davos? - You'll pray for a quick death.
- [CHUCKLES] TYRION: Ser Brienne? Mm-mm.
Mmm High in the halls Of the kings who are gone Jenny would dance With her ghosts The ones she had lost And the ones she had found And the ones Who had loved her the most The ones who'd been gone For so very long She couldn't remember Their names They spun her around On the damp old stones Spun away all her sorrow And pain And she never wanted To leave Never wanted to leave Never wanted to leave Never wanted to leave Never wanted to leave Never wanted to leave DAENERYS: Who's that? Lyanna Stark.
My brother Rhaegar everyone told me he was decent and kind.
He liked to sing.
Gave money to poor children.
And he raped her.
JON: He didn't.
He loved her.
They were married in secret.
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son.
Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it.
So the last thing she did as she bled to death on her birthing bed was give the boy to her brother Ned Stark to raise as his bastard.
[] My name my real name is Aegon Targaryen.
[EXHALES SHARPLY] - That's impossible.
- I wish it were.
Who told you this? Bran.
- He saw it.
- He saw it? And Samwell confirmed it.
He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend.
Doesn't seem strange to you? It's true, Dany.
I know it is.
If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen.
You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.

1 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) Who would you say is the father? You.
I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
Our queen has a keen sense of poetic justice.
What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers? JON SNOW: My name my real name is Aegon Targaryen.
It's true, Dany.
If it were true you'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.
ARYA STARK: She doesn't like your queen, does she? She's defending our family.
I'm her family, too.

To our fathers and mothers.
To our friends.
Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live.
Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid.
It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath.
They were the shields that guarded the realms of men.
And we shall never see their like again.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: To your health.
Have you seen Arya? You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at.
- I just want to thank her for-- - I'm sure you do.
Look, it's not about that.
Of course it's about that, you twat.
Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead.
You're not.
Gendry.
[CHATTERING STOPS] That's right, isn't it? Yes, Your Grace.
You're Robert Baratheon's son.
You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered? I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.
Yes, he's dead.
His brothers are too.
So who's Lord of Storm's End now? I don't know, Your Grace.
Does anyone? I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
[PEOPLE MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] I can't be.
I'm a bastard.
No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.
Because that is what I have made you.
To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.

[MEN LAUGH] JAIME: We fought dead things and lived to talk about it.
If this isn't the time to drink, when is? The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.
- I do.
- So did you? Never got the chance.
She did it to herself.
Or her god did it to her.
Lord of Light.
We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off.
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants? I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
And what if I'm not trying to be happy? Then you're in luck.
We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.
Thank you.
I feel much better.
[LAUGHING BOISTEROUSLY] MAN: More ale! This is clever.
Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.
I liked that one.
You know our history better than anyone.
That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
You don't want it.
I don't really want anymore.
I envy you.
You shouldn't envy me.
Mostly I live in the past.
- TORMUND: All of it.
- Go on.
- No, not in one go.
- Go on.
I believe in you.
TORMUND: We have to celebrate our victory.
Vomiting is not celebrating.

- I told you I was.
- You didn't.
- I did.
- I surmised it.
Drink.
Go again.
Why does he get to go again? Because it's my game.
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.
No.
TYRION: Drink.
MAN: The other way around! I saw him riding that thing.
- We all did.
- No.
No.
I saw him riding that thing.
- That's right, you did.
- I did.
That's why we all agreed to follow him.
That's the kind of man he is.
He's little [CHUCKLES] but he's strong.
Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it! Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.
- [GRUNTS] - TORMUND: Not this one.
[MEN LAUGHING] Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.
Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting.
Here, north of the Wall, and then back here again.
He keeps fighting.
He keeps fighting.
He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought.
What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A madman or a king! [CROWD CHEERING] [] - TYRION: Drink.
- Drink.
Drink.
[LAUGHING] [MEN SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink! [BOTH LAUGHING] Mm! You were married.
Before Sansa.
- Drink.
- [GROWLS] You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale! No! [LAUGHS] You're a virgin.
That's a statement about the present.
At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man.
Or a woman.
I have to piss.
We did it! We faced those icy fucks.
Looked right into their blue eyes, and here we are.
[SIGHS] Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants? [GUFFAWS] Please pardon me for a moment.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Drink it! And after all that, this fucker comes north and takes her from me.
Just takes her, like that.
I mean it, Clegane.
My heart is broken.
Don't touch me.
WILLA: You can touch me.
I'm not afraid of wildlings.
Maybe you should be.
[TORMUND CHUCKLING] Well, Clegane it's time to drown our sorrows.
I'm not done with my drink.
- [SIGHS] - MAN 2: You saved the day.
MAN 1: You owe me one.
- Don't forget that.
- MAN 2: For the rest of my days.
Are you ready now? This is my drink.
[GROWLING] All right! SANSA: She could have made you happy, for a little while.
There's only one thing that'll make me happy.
And what's that? That's my fucking business.
Used to be you couldn't look at me.
That was a long time ago.
I've seen much worse than you since then.
HOUND: Yes, I've heard.
Heard you were broken in.
Heard you were broken in rough.
And he got what he deserved.
I gave it to him.
How? Hounds.
[CHUCKLES] You've changed, Little Bird.
None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me.
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay none of it.
Without Littlefinger, and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life.
[CHUCKLES] [ALL LAUGHING] - MAN 1: Hey! - MAN 2: Pour another one.
[GASPS] Don't shoot.
It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating.
You should be celebrating with them.
I am celebrating.
Yeah, I am too.
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.
I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End.
By order of the queen.
Congratulations.
I don't know how to be lord of anything.
I hardly know how to use a fork.
All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me.
So be with me.
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.
[] You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you.
But I'm not a lady.
I never have been.
That's not me.
[BOWSTRING CREAKS] [ARROW THWACKS WOOD] [THUMPING ON DOOR] [WIND WHISTLING] You didn't drink.
- I didn't drink? - In the game.
- I drank.
- In the game.
This is Dornish.
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.
Suit yourself.
You keep it warm enough in here.
It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North.
Keep your fire going.
Every time you leave the room, put more wood on.
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.
It grows on you.
I don't want things growing on me.
How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.
You sound quite jealous.
I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here.
[CHUCKLES] [] Oh, move aside.
What are you doing? I'm taking your shirt off.
I've never slept with a knight before.
I've never slept with anyone before.
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.
I told you-- [WIND WHISTLING] Are you drunk? No.
[CHUCKLES] Only a little.
[SIGHS] I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this.
If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you.
He loved me.
And I couldn't love him back.
Not the way he wanted.
Not the way I love you.
Is that all right? [SIGHS] I wish you'd never told me.
If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.
I try to forget.
Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you.
I saw the way they looked at you.
I know that look.
So many people have looked at me that way, but never here.
Never on this side of the sea.
I told you I don't want it.
It doesn't matter what you want.
You didn't want to be King in the North.
What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine? I'll refuse.
You are my queen.
I don't know what else I can say.
You can say nothing.
To anyone, ever.
Never tell them who you really are.
Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else.
Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people.
No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.
I want it to be the way it was between us.
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.
Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.
She won't.
She's not the girl you grew up with.
Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her.
I owe them the truth.
Even if the truth destroys us? - It won't.
- It will.
I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you.
[SOFTLY] Don't do this.
Please.
You are my queen.
Nothing will change that.
And they are my family.
We can live together.
We can.
I've just told you how.
[] [SIGHS] Half are gone.
The Northmen as well.
And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.
The balance has grown distressingly even.
When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-- Cersei will make sure they don't believe it.
We will hit her hard.
We will rip her out root and stem.
The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.
VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day.
Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name.
The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.
No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
We need the capital.
I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began.
Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside.
JON: We'll surround the city.
If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them.
If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field.
Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.
All right.
SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted.
Many of them are wounded.
They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.
How long do you suggest? SANSA: I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers.
I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself.
Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.
It's not just our people.
It's yours.
You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight? The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.
[] The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
What you command, we will obey.
TYRION: So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.
A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.
We have won the Great War.
Now we will win the Last War.
In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen.
We need a word.
You understand we'd all be dead if not for her.
We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.
Arya's the one that killed the Night King.
Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell-- And we will never forget them.
That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who-- I swore myself and the North to her cause.
I respect that.
You respect it? We needed her.
We needed her army, her dragons.
You did the right thing.
And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.
She's not one of us.
If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies.
That's all right.
I don't need many allies.
- JON: Arya - We're family.
The four of us.
The last of the Starks.
I've never been a Stark.
SANSA: You are.
You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.
You're my brother.
Not my half-brother or my bastard brother.
My brother.
It's your choice.
I need to tell you something.
But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
What is it? You have to swear it, before I tell you.
How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is? Because we're family.
Swear it.
I swear it.
I swear it.
Tell them.
TYRION: So she's going to stay here with you? She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so Say something snide.
I'm happy.
I'm happy that you're happy.
I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
[LAUGHS] Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes? To climbing mountains.
[CUPS CLINK] To climbing mountains.
- What's she like down there? - What? That's not your concern.
I haven't been with a woman for years.
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.
BRONN: I knew you were fucking her.
A pair of tall, blond toffs.
Must be like looking in the mirror.
TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
Where's your drink? What are you-- What are you doing up North? What are you doing with that? Oh, this? This is for you.
For both of you.
TYRION: You're supposed to be south.
You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.
- Do you know that? - That's a bit rude.
Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, - and what do I have to show? - You're a knight, thanks to me.
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.
Power resides where men believe-- BRONN: Shut your mouth.
- TYRION: I'm just trying-- - I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.
See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-- You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck.
And your best days are long gone.
[GROANS] You broke my nose! - I did not break your nose.
- How do you know? Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.
Your sister offered me Riverrun.
Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told.
- And you trust Cersei-- - I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons.
Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win.
And it just so happens I'm a betting man.
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead.
Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one.
- All of a sudden - TYRION: May I speak? Why not? Only death will shut you up.
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember? If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double.
What's double Riverrun? Highgarden.
You could be Lord of the Reach.
- Highgarden? Are you mad? - It's better than being dead.
He's not going to kill us.
He wouldn't be talking to us if-- The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.
Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats.
That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people.
Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord.
Kill a few thousand, they make you king.
And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.
Highgarden.
Give me your word.
You have my word.
None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing.
We ride south in the morning.
We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, no.
No, my fighting days are done.
But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I'll come find you when the war is done.
Till then, don't die.
[DOOR CLOSES] For fuck's sake.
On your own? HOUND: Not anymore.
I don't like crowds.
ARYA: Me neither.
HOUND: Why not? They all love you now.
You're the big hero.
Don't like heroes.
It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
Felt better than dying.
You're heading to King's Landing? I have some unfinished business.
Me too.
I don't plan on coming back.
Neither do I.
Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt? Probably.
[CHUCKLES] [] [GROWLING SOFTLY] My lady.
"My lord" is the standard response.
Why her? TYRION: You know she loves your brother.
That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
You seem determined to dislike her.
A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known.
Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely.
I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
Well, I suppose that's up to him.
Sansa, look at me.
With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North.
I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies.
What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him.
Your queen still has her dragons-- She's your queen too.
You don't have to be her friend.
But why provoke her? How is that in the best interest of your family, - or the North, or--? - You're afraid of her.
Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
I don't want Jon to go down there.
The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark.
[SIGHS] Are you all right? [] Her people love her, you've seen that.
You've seen how they fight for her.
She wants to make the world a better place.
I believe in her.
Tyrion.
What if there's someone else? Someone better? You're not gonna ride the dragon south? Just a horse.
Rhaegal needs to heal.
He doesn't need me weighing him down.
[SCOFFS] You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
[CHUCKLES] I'm taking the Free Folk home.
We've had enough of the south.
The women down here don't like me.
This is the North, you know.
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.
It isn't home.
We need room to wander.
I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass.
Back where we belong.
It's where he belongs too.
A direwolf has no place in the south.
Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.
So would you.
I wish I was going with you.
This is farewell, then.
You never know.
You've got the North in you.
The real North.
Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown.
There's only so many books a person can read, so we-- I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.
I hope it's a girl.
[] [SNIFFLES] [BOTH SNIFFLE] You're the best friend I ever had.
You too, Sam.
[GHOST WHINES] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] TYRION: Think of the past 20 years.
The war, the murder, the misery.
All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back.
How many others know? Including us? Eight.
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.
It's information.
If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon.
Then what happens? She loses the North.
She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that.
No, it's worse than that.
He has the better claim to the throne.
He doesn't want the throne.
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.
The fact is, people are drawn to him.
Wildlings, Northmen.
He's a war hero.
He loves our queen.
And she loves him.
If we marry them, they could rule together.
She's his aunt.
That never stopped a Targaryen before.
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.
Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do.
Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned.
Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
I worry about her state of mind.
We are advisors to the queen.
Worrying about her state of mind is our job.
We still have to take King's Landing.
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.
That would solve our problems.
[] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [SCREECHING] [GURGLING] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [GASPS] [] [MEN GRUNT] [GRUNTS] [YELLING] [GRUNTING] [] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [MEN GRUNTING] Get to the skiff.
Now! [] SOLDIER 1: Spears! SOLDIER 2: They're coming round again! [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] SOLDIER 3: Go! SOLDIER 4: Clear! SOLDIER 5: Man your stations! - [GRUNTS] - MISSANDEI: No! [GRUNTS] - SOLDIER 4: Go! Go! - SOLDIER 5: Clear! [ALL COUGHING AND GROANING] Missandei? [PANTING] Missandei! Missandei! [GASPS] CERSEI: Our message was well-received, then? QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming.
They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.
You're certain about the dragon? I saw it sink beneath the waves.
That must have been glorious.
The glory is yours, my queen.
When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea and our child shall one day rule them all.
[] [CHUCKLES] [SOFTLY] She's coming for you.
Of course she is.
Keep the gates open.
If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first.
So much for "the Breaker of Chains.
" [MISSANDEI PANTING] GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen.
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.
VARYS: Your Grace.
I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake.
This is a mistake.
You saw my child fall from the sky.
They took Missandei.
VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die.
That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep.
These are the people you came here to protect.
I beg you, Your Grace.
Do not destroy the city you came to save.
Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.
Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants.
That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost.
It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing.
In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender.
Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.
If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.
Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter.
But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused.
They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.
[] I've served tyrants most of my life.
They all talk about destiny.
She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons.
How could she not believe in destiny? Perhaps that's the problem.
Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.
And how do you know she wasn't? Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.
Perhaps it's actually a solution.
You know them both.
Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler? He doesn't want the throne.
That's why he bent the knee.
Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule? We're discussing treason.
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.
Joffrey was a man.
I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.
And he's the heir to the throne.
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.
What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
She's too strong for him.
She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.
He could temper her worst impulses.
As you have? You're drinking quite a lot.
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.
Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.
Even if you know it's a mistake? I believe in our queen.
She'll make the right choice.
With the help of her loyal advisors.
You know where my loyalty stands.
You know I will never betray the realm.
What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.
Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne.
We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I.
They deserve to live.
They deserve food for their children.
I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.
So, what happens to her? Please.
Don't.
I've spoken as honestly as I can.
Each of us has a choice to make.
I pray we choose wisely.

Thank you.
WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you.
MAN 5: We need some more water.
MAN 3: Take it down there! as are the rest of her advisors.
What happened? Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet.
One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured.
I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.
Seems like I won't get the chance.
[] [DOOR CLOSES] They're going to destroy that city.
You know they will.
JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight? You're not like your sister.
You're not.
You're better than she is.
You're a good man and you can't save her.
You don't need to die with her.
Stay here.
Stay with me.
[VOICE BREAKING] Please.
Stay.
[] You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei.
I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei.
I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.
[INHALES SHARPLY] She's hateful.
And so am I.
[SOBBING] [HORSE NEIGHS] [BREATHING SHAKILY] [SOLDIER SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [GATE RATTLING] My lord.
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender.
If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now.
Qyburn you're a rational man.
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.
We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.
Yes.
Help me.
I don't want to see this city burn.
I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.
No, it is not a pleasant sound.
I-- I don't want to hear it.
Help me save this city.
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.
TYRION: Your queen.
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
You are her subject.
Her reign is over.
You understand this.
Help her understand it.
We understand nothing of the sort.
Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.
Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan-- [] CAPTAIN: Ready! Nock! Draw! [INHALES DEEPLY] [] I know you don't care about your people.
Why should you? They hate you and you hate them.
But you're not a monster.
I know this.
I know this because I've seen it.
You've always loved your children.
More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything.
I beg you.
If not for yourself, then for your child.
Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end.
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.
[EXHALES SHAKILY] If you have any last words, now is the time.
[BREATHING HEAVILY] [BREATHING SHAKILY] Dracarys.
[BREATHING SHAKILY] [MOUTHS] No.
[BREATHING SHAKILY] [] 
1 We have won the Great War.
Now we will win the last war.
TYRION LANNISTER: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.
ARYA STARK: You heading to King's Landing? THE HOUND: There's some unfinished business.
ARYA: Me too.
THE HOUND: I don't plan on coming back.
Neither do I.
I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.
Seems like I won't get the chance.
BRIENNE OF TARTH: (TEARFULLY) Stay with me.
Please.
Cersei's hateful And so am I.
(SOBS) I need to tell you something.
But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
What if there's someone else? Someone better.
At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.
Even if you know it's a mistake? He has the better claim to the throne.
CERSEI LANNISTER: Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin.
BARRISTAN SELMY: The Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.
TYRION: Children are not their fathers.
- OLENNA TYRELL: Be a dragon.
- JORAH MORMONT: You have a gentle heart.
AEMON TARGARYEN: A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing.
VISERYS TARGARYEN: You don't want to awake the dragon, do you? (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in.
[DOOR OPENS] And? Nothing? She won't eat.
[] We'll try again at supper.
I think they're watching me.
- Who? - Her soldiers.
Of course they are.
That's their job.
What have I told you, Martha? The greater the risk, the greater the reward.
Go on.
They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
[DOOR CLOSES] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] VARYS: The Northern armies? JON: Just crossed the Trident.
They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.
How is she? She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.
Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.
She shouldn't be alone.
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.
Aren't you worried for her? I'm worried for all of us.
They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.
We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
We both know what she's about to do.
[SIGHS] That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.
Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.
What do you want? All I've ever wanted.
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.
I still don't know how her coin has landed.
But I'm quite certain about yours.
I don't want it.
I never have.
[SIGHS] I have known more kings and queens than any man living.
I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows.
I have furthered their designs, however horrible.
But what I tell you now is true: You will rule wisely and well, while she-- She is my queen.
[] [EXHALES SOFTLY] Your Grace? There's something you need to know.
Someone has betrayed me.
Yes.
Jon Snow.
Varys.
He knows the truth about Jon.
He does.
Because you told him.
You learned from Sansa.
And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her.
As I said he betrayed me.
TYRION: I'm glad Sansa told me.
I am your Hand.
I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
And Varys? Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
You spoke to him first.
Without coming to me.
Without asking my permission.
It was a mistake.
Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain? - She trusts me.
- Yes, she trusts you.
She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen.
And you did not let her down.
[] If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me.
Our intentions were good.
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.
Varys as much as anyone.
But it doesn't matter now.
No.
It doesn't matter now.
[DOOR OPENS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [EXHALES HEAVILY] [] It was me.
I hope I deserve this.
Truly, I do.
I hope I'm wrong.
[INHALES AND EXHALES SHARPLY] Goodbye, old friend.
Lord Varys.
[INHALES SHARPLY] I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons sentence you to die.
[GROWLING] Dracarys.
[ROARS] [GROWLS] [] This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea.
Her only possession.
happen if you told your sister? I don't want it, and that's what I told him.
She betrayed your trust.
She killed Varys as much as I did.
This was a victory for her.
Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you.
Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.
I don't have love here.
I only have fear.
I love you.
And you will always be my queen.
Is that all I am to you? Your queen? [JON EXHALES HEAVILY] [SOFTLY] All right, then.
Let it be fear.
TYRION: The people who live there, they're not your enemies.
They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.
DAENERYS: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.
TYRION: They're afraid.
Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered.
You can't expect them to be heroes.
- They're hostages.
- They are.
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine? What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them.
That's what she thinks our mercy is: weakness.
- I beg you, my queen-- - But she's wrong.
Mercy is our strength.
Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
Ready the Unsullied.
Tonight you sail for King's Landing - to join the Northern armies.
- Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost.
Give them that chance.
- [INHALES SHARPLY] - If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.
Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.
DAENERYS: Wait for me outside the city.
You'll know when it's time.
DAENERYS: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
[] It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all.
The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
[DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] GUARD 1: Let them pass.
[BABY CRYING] GUARD 2: Through the gate.
GUARD 3: Get going.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] DAVOS: The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
TYRION: She wants to attack now.
Daybreak at the earliest.
SOLDIER 1: Careful with that.
SOLDIER 2: My lord.
TYRION: Davos.
I need to ask you a favor.
You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you? I'm not gonna like this favor, am I? SOLDIER 1: He's always better when he's got some food in him.
SOLDIER 2: Problem is when he's got drink in him.
See what he did the other week? SOLDIER 1: Aye.
Fighting as well.
Commander nearly caught him.
Ay up.
Where you going? I'm Arya Stark.
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.
[CHUCKLES] I need to go talk to my captain.
Go ahead, talk to him.
SOLDIER 1: Where's he going? [CLEARS THROAT] We speak the common tongue.
Ah.
Good.
I want to be alone with the prisoner.
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.
UNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.
Ordered by whom? The queen herself? - No.
- TYRION: Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order.
Probably by quite a lot.
How did they find you? Did you consider taking it off? Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister.
" And you're going back to her, to die with her.
You've underestimated her before.
She's going to die.
Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
Difficult to do from here.
[EXHALES HEAVILY] When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything? Try.
If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.
To be honest, I never really cared much for them.
Innocent or otherwise.
You do care for one innocent.
I know you do.
And so does Cersei.
She has a reason now.
The child is the reason she'll never give an inch.
All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children.
It's not impossible that she'll win.
She won't.
Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.
Two of the three dragons are dead.
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.
She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-- I defended the city last time it was attacked.
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.
Why? Escape.
The two of you, together.
Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there.
Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go.
You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep.
A dinghy will be waiting for you.
Sail out of the bay.
If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos.
Start a new life.
Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-- There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer.
Do it.
If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.
Swear to me.
You have my word.
If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates.
That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.
I'll try.
I never thought I'd get to repay the favor.
Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.
Your queen will execute you for this.
If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.
Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade.
If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood.

You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster.

[DOOR CLOSES] Did you bring any wine? No.
Ah Well thank you for coming to see me.
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long.
I suppose there's a crude kind of justice.
I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn.
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes: "See, I told you.
" It just occurred to me.
I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.
[SIGHS] So is there life after death? Not that I've seen.
I should be thankful.
Oblivion is the best I could hope for.
I strangled my lover.
I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I betrayed my queen.
- You didn't.
- I did.
And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen.
I chose my fate.
The people of King's Landing did not.
I can't justify what happened.
I won't try.
- But the war is over now.
- Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting? She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay.
She liberated the people of King's Landing.
And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
And you've been by her side, counseling her.
Until today.
[SOFTLY] Until today.
Varys was right.
I was wrong.
It was vanity to think I could guide her.
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too.
She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.
Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.
Cersei left her no choice.
The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.
She saw her friend beheaded.
She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
And she burned down a city for it.
Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.
Would you have done it? What? You've been up there, on a dragon's back.
You've had that power.
Would you have burned the city down? - I don't know.
- [SCOFFS] Yes, you do.
You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.
What's it matter what I'd do? It matters more than anything.
When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained.
After all, they were evil men.
[SIGHS] When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men.
The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her.
Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it.
And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.
She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone.
If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise? [JON INHALES DEEPLY] I know you love her.
I love her too.
Not as successfully as you.
But I believed in her with all my heart.
Love is more powerful than reason.
[SNIFFLES] We all know that.
Look at my brother.
"Love is the death of duty.
" [SNIFFLES] You just came up with that? Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
Sometimes duty is the death of love.
[SNIFFLES] You are the shield that guards the realms of men.
And you've always tried to do the right thing.
No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people.
Who is the greatest threat to the people now? It's a terrible thing I'm asking.
It's also the right thing.
Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne? [EXHALES SHAKILY] That's her decision.
She is the queen.
I'm sorry it came to this.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR] And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.
But you do.
[KEY RATTLING] And you have to choose now.
[] [GROWLS SOFTLY] [WOMAN VOCALIZING] [] [] When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies.
What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb.
So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.
JON: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street.
They said they were acting on your orders.
- It was necessary.
- Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned! I tried to make peace with Cersei.
She used their innocence as a weapon against me.
She thought it would cripple me.
And Tyrion? He conspired behind my back with my enemies.
How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart? Forgive him.
- I can't.
- You can.
You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake.
Make them understand.
Please, Dany.
We can't hide behind small mercies.
The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
The world we need is a world of mercy.
It has to be.
And it will be.
It's not easy to see something that's never been before.
[] A good world.
How do you know? How do you know it'll be good? Because I know what is good.
And so do you.
- I don't.
- You do.
You do.
You've always known.
What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
They don't get to choose.
Be with me.
Build the new world with me.
This is our reason.
It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20.
We do it together.
[SOFTLY] We break the wheel together.
You are my queen.
Now, and always.
[] [GRUNTS] [BOTH PANTING] [GASPING SOFTLY] [EXHALES] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [CRYING] [] [DROGON GROWLING] [DROGON ROARING] [] [GROWLING] [SNIFFS] [GROWLING] [ROARING] [] [] [WINGS FLAPPING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Where's Jon? - He is our prisoner.
- SANSA: So is Lord Tyrion.
They were both to be brought to this gathering.
We will decide what we do with our prisoners.
This is our city now.
If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.
And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
Some of you may be quick to forgive.
The Ironborn are not.
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
You swore to follow a tyrant.
She freed us from a tyrant.
Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.
Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.
Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
Friends, please.
We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly? If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead.
This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try.
There is land in the Reach.
Good land.
The people that used to live there are gone.
Make it your own.
Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen.
We've had enough war.
Thousands of you, thousands of them.
You know how it ends.
We need to find a better way.
We do not need payment.
We need justice.
Jon Snow cannot go free.
It's not for you to decide.
You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
You're right.
And no one's any better for it.
But it's not for you to decide.
Jon committed his crime here.
His fate is for our king to decide.
Or our queen.
We don't have a king or queen.
You're the most powerful people in Westeros.
Choose one.
Make your choice, then.
My lords and ladies [CLEARS THROAT] I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives.
What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history.
I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country.
A veteran of two wars.
And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-- - SANSA: Uncle? Please sit.
[SCOFFS] [CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY] [STUMBLES] [SIGHS] Well, we have to choose someone.
Um, ahem Why just us? Um-- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies.
Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.
[ALL LAUGHING] Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
I'll ask my horse.
I suppose you want the crown.
Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then? I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks.
About our bloody history.
About the mistakes we've made.
What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories.
There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.
Nothing can stop it.
No enemy can defeat it.
And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived.
He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly.
He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven.
He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories.
The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines.
Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past.
Who better to lead us into the future? Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
Good.
Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know.
His will never torment us.
That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.
[] From now on, rulers will not be born.
They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.
I know you don't want it.
I know you don't care about power.
But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day? Why do you think I came all this way? To Brandon of House Stark I say aye.
[] SAMWELL: Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
MAN 1: Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
MAN 2: Aye.
YARA: Aye.
MAN 3: Aye.
MAN 4: Aye.
Aye.
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.
Aye.
I love you, little brother.
I always will.
You'll be a good king.
But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros.
And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again.
The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.
[] All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
ALL: All hail Bran the Broken! [] BRAN: Lord Tyrion you will be my Hand.
N-- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.
BRAN: And I don't want to be king.
I don't deserve it.
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.
I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't.
Choose Ser Davos.
Choose anyone else.
- I choose you.
- You cannot.
Yes, I can.
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.
He's made many terrible mistakes.
He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
It is not enough.
TYRION: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war.
Letting you walk free would start a war.
So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
There's still a Night's Watch? The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
[SIGHS] You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence.
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace.
No one is very happy.
Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.
Was it right? What I did? What we did.
It doesn't feel right.
Ask me again in 10 years.
I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
I wouldn't be so sure.
A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
[] [HORSE NEIGHS] [MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [IN VALYRIAN] [IN VALYRIAN] [] SANSA: I wish there had been another way.
Can you forgive me? The North is free, thanks to you.
But they lost their king.
Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them.
She's the best they could ask for.
[] You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.
I can't.
You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed? [CHUCKLES] I'm not going back north.
Where are you going? What's west of Westeros? [CHUCKLES] I don't know.
No one knows.
It's where all the maps stop.
That's where I'm going.
You have your Needle? Right here.

I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.
He's not kind? - He - He what? What does he say about me? I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.

Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.

Perhaps I can find him.
Do carry on with the rest.

[CLEARS THROAT, COUGHS] Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid? In full, my lord Hand.
Good.
Time to start incurring a new one.
We have hungry people to feed.
Can we expect some assistance in this regard? BRONN: Indeed we can.
Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.
We have.
These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.
"Any more.
" You Master of Grammar now too? Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.
The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-- The strong live and the weak don't.
Find the best builders and set them to the task.
BRONN: Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down.
The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.
SAMWELL: Uh the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
BRONN: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.
BRIENNE: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
BRONN: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.

CAULFIELD: Steve didn't respond to us about the direwolves because they can go pretty fast.
He says 30 miles per hour.
Right, right, right, right, right.
Okay.
So it's our biggest season ever, there's a lot of decisions that need to be made.
It's something simple like a wolf running with a guy, for us it means a 150-foot green screen with a tracking vehicle in Calgary.
You know, it's fun.
It's a fun puzzle to figure out, you know, and when you do figure it out it's I think that's why I used to love algebra, is that you'd figure out the equation, when you got that answer it was like, "Wow.
" And so it's the same with this.
We keep messing with the puzzle, and then when that last piece fits, you're like, "Yeah, it worked.
" [CHUCKLES] STAFFER: For you.
My schedule ends up being It's, you know, very and that's a simple one.
Like the Art Department, they go horizontally, but I decided I want to go I go vertically.

What? It's all I've done since I left school, I don't know anything else.
[] NEWMAN: The way Game of Thrones is developed is every episode has as much in it as any one feature film, but we have to do it quicker and for less money.
All you can do with any large operation is get the best people around you and let them go.
As we said, we're trying to figure out how [CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] BLAIR: This is our first day of fittings, and we're just doing 25, I think it is, today.
We have the same people, like, every year.
It's really nice, they're like a little family.

I remember being in Dubrovnik.
And I remember saying to him, we're never gonna be allowed to shoot here.
Just knowing what we had to do.
Nobody was going to let them destroy their town, no matter where we were, particularly not Dubrovnik.
Then when we looked outside of the production office, there's this great big, flat piece of concreted land, you know, the Titanic studios need a backlot, and there was one really obvious one sitting here.
Phil and I are both scratching out different ideas for our King's Landing street.
We've been so many places and photographed so many things that, uh it's actually trying to work out what makes these things fantastic.
But it's gonna be a big build, so we need to make sure it's worth the money and time that'll be invested.
Also they're not sacrificing going to a location to, instead, be shooting in a really bad set.
March 2013, when I first landed it was so daunting, but at the same time, we just couldn't let ourselves fail.
I don't have it so much anymore, but I do, in the first year, remember having this constant tape in my head of you are being employed to cope.

I don't like to give away too much money.
I don't like to waste anything.
I know it's not mine, but don't waste it, you know? FINLAY: What are you gonna do if it snows? If it snows? Oh, probably have a party.
If it snows, yeah, cover the whole lot in white.
That would be fantastic.
But it's just not going to happen.
It just rains in Belfast.
[LAUGHS] [MACHINERY BEEPING] MAN [ON WALKIE]: Must be Naomi there.
LISTON: If that's horse feed, it needs to come up to me at the horse marquee.
MAN: They're fucking lying everywhere.
LISTON: What the fuck are you talking about? MAN: They've been threw off.
They're lying everywhere.
LISTON: They came on a tipper so we just have to fucking tip them into the fucking grass.
MAN: Yeah, no worries.
LISTON: So I'm the location manager.
You can have 350 crew, and with that comes the infrastructure, service vehicles, extras, marquees.
I sort of end up doing all the logistics and the running of all the locations when we're out and about, which is great fun.
[HORN HONKS] We'll have to use our imagination a little bit.
- This 25-by-50 meter is extras holding.
- We have to avoid this manhole cover, so when you bring the crowd up, the door to the crowd holding will be here.
The only problem is these big gas canisters, that's all propane.
You cannot sit there having a fag, otherwise the whole thing's gonna go up.
LISTON: That's an electric fence, so they'll not be tempted to dander up past the electric fence.
MAN: - Yeah.
- [WOMAN LAUGHS] MAN [ON WALKIE]: We've got caltrops in place where they're gonna be, so we can, um, hide them for the switch.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] We just then They [IMITATING WHOOSHING] [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] I need to go a little bit higher.
I can see the legs and the heads.
But actually want to see them how they jump.
- Just adjust.
- And then watch it, - you can see the - IRLAM: I've said to the guys the thing that they should focus on is planning where they're going and making sure they all miss each other.
Let's put caltrops in front of caltrops.
So you create much more of a barrier, yeah? DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, action! [ALL SNARLING] DIRECTOR: Cut.
Good.
- DIRECTOR: Action! - [GRUNTS] No! [SCREAMING] DIRECTOR: One.
Action! [SCREAMING] SHAPCOTT: It's about choreographing the fights with Ratsa and Vlad.
It's basically what we do on film set.
[ACTOR SCREAMS, THUDS] It's what we do on a film set, we just do it in a tent.
I think they kill him, and kill him [GRUNTING] SHAPCOTT: By the time we come to shoot it, the producers know what the fight is, the director knows, the actors know.
Everybody knows what's going on.
[GRUNTING] SHAPCOTT: This is one we did yesterday.
This is like the end.
[SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [CHOIR VOCALIZING] [GROANS] SHAPCOTT: So each hero moment we do something like that for.
There's a moment here where you do the two of them meet.
So why don't you Riley? Take that light back a bit, and we'll take a photograph of these fine people.
[IMITATES WHOOSHING] And hit that, good.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
NUTTER: I've been brought in this season to introduce Episodes 1, 2, and 4 to the throng out there that have been waiting to see the final season of Game of Thrones.
I'm getting into the consequences of what happens to people in their lives, the war that's coming, and of course how that affects people.
NUTTER: Okay.
STRAPAZON: Thanks, we'll be in touch.
Thanks.
STRAPAZON: He breaks down his scripts, which I help him do.
He gets floor plans printed out that he cuts up and then blocks out where the characters are gonna go, where they move to, where the camera's gonna go.
And it's a little road map for the whole scene.
He draws it all by hand, and he likes it on U.
S.
letter-size paper, which is like 8 1/2 by 11, I think.
- FINLAY: Not A4? - No, he doesn't A4, it doesn't work.
So we shipped over a big box of goldenrod paper.
FINLAY: Why does A4 not work? [SIGHS] Don't question the system.
This is my nemesis, this copy machine.
[FINLAY CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] It's upside down.
STRAPAZON: He is one of the few people on the show that has printed scripts.
They were trying to go all digital this year, have everything on iPads, but that's just not how he rolls.
He claims he's a Luddite, but, you know, he's done some of the most iconic episodes.
He did the Red Wedding and the Walk of Shame.
FINLAY: What is that a drawing of, on the top there? NUTTER: That's a dead Theon, and that's Sansa overtop of him.
- FINLAY: On your special paper.
- NUTTER: On my special paper.
FINLAY: How long have you used this process? NUTTER: Since the very beginning.
- FINLAY: Did someone teach you? - I taught myself.
This is my method.
My methodology.
My stuff goes in that safe there, nothing gets left out.
If you touch the paper at the wrong time it will dissolve like Mission Impossible and burn up.
[CHUCKLES] [] WOMAN: We're doing it tomorrow.
It needs to be up here.
ALEXANDER: It is, well, just 20 past 4, yeah.
[LAUGHS] So yeah, those 4 or 5:00 starts are quite regular.
I think half past 3 has been the earliest, when we were in Morocco.
[BOTH LAUGH] ALEXANDER: Cheers, all right.
- Good morning, darling.
- CLARKE: Hi.
- BANKS: How are you? - CLARKE: All right.
ALEXANDER: Emilia's generally got dark hair, so when you put the wig on, it looks like it's got roots.
CLARKE: This is the sexy bit.
So we have to put a little cap over that kills any dark.
FINLAY: I don't think anyone knows it's this much work.
No.
Also this is very lucky, to see this bit.
This is normally when someone like a producer knocks on the door and you're like, "Not now!" - Please, don't come in.
- [ALL LAUGHING] [COUGHS] ALEXANDER: Gilly's gone glamorous.
BANKS: Ooh.
She has.
Looks very nice.
- ALEXANDER: A weekend look.
- [ALL CHUCKLE] CLARKE: BANKS: No, it is, because that is still the most beautiful hair I will ever have on my head, ever.
[LAUGHS] It's magical.
When you put that on, it's just an instant whoa.
- BANKS: There she is.
- CLARKE: Oh my God, there she is.
My heart is in my throat when I think about this not happening much longer.
Putting this on.
It gets Genuinely gets me really, like [GULPS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] RILEY: Look at that.
Beautiful.
Rhiannon did all of this.
These beautiful illuminated scripts.
And then the magic's over again.
It was beautiful.
CAULFIELD: It's a simple enough scene, no? Yeah, yeah.
It's a great start.
Everybody's like, "Oh, I'm so happy this is how we're starting.
" And so it's perfect.
And he's so excited to be here, which is so sweet too.
That he's, like, thanking me.
No, I'm thanking you.
No, I'm thanking you.
So yeah.
I know, he's just so excited that he got to do And to do three, 50 percent of the final season.
He does that I call it the penguin walk, it's like, "Oh, the penguin's released.
" ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Good morning.
If we could give David a little privacy for this first rehearsal please? Thank you.
CAULFIELD: Here we go.
- [WHOOPING] - [CHUCKLES] SAMWELL: If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.
For what crime? SAMWELL: I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.
STRAPAZON: I love me some Dragon Queen.
I love Daenerys.
I love dragons.
I would hope that I would be a Targaryen, minus the whole are they crazy, are they not crazy, the incest thing and all that stuff.
But, um, being able to go from, you know, waiting and watching it on my couch to then being on the set when they're shooting the final season, it's been kind of surreal.
FINLAY: Do we need to let you go do your job? STRAPAZON: It would be good.
I'm going to bring him almonds, which will be very good.
Protein, fuel him on set, make sure he's got everything going.
I'm like his stamina elf.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - STRAPAZON: Almonds? - NUTTER: Thank you.
STRAPAZON: Do you want any yang herbs? - Oh, yes, yes.
- Okay, yeah, I'll go get it.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: And roll sound, please.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Thirty-nine Apple, take one.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Quiet on the set.
NUTTER: First shot of the last season.
- And - [PEOPLE CHUCKLE] - CAMERA: Set.
- SOUND: Set.
NUTTER: Action.
SAMWELL: Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Your brother stood with your father.
I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee.
He refused.
SAMWELL: Um, thank you, Your Grace, for telling me.
May I? DAENERYS: Of course.
MAN [ON PA]: Cut there.
[BELL RINGS] McCRUM: Basically it's called the heart attack van.
We just follow them 'round everywhere.
We tried to do healthy stuff, but they like things that'll keep them going.
The tiger toast thing started just one day whenever I was feeling a bit peckish myself when I was in Tesco's doing my shopping.
I thought I'll go buy a tiger loaf and have a wee toastie, and I made it fully loaded like this for myself.
One of the guys happened to notice it and went, "What are you making?" "Making myself a wee toastie.
" He says, "Can I have one?" Next thing everybody was coming, "Can I have one?" And now it's one of the most popular things here.
Bacon, chicken, cheese, ham, tomato, onion, tobacco onions, on the big tiger bread.
- McCRUM: Hello.
- How are you? - McCRUM: What's the crack? - Not much.
- Good.
Wee toastie? - Yeah.
McCRUM: What sauce would you like on yours? Thanks very much, see you later.
CUSTOMER: Thank you.
FINLAY: What are you doing today? Jaime Lannister trousers.
[FINLAY CHUCKLES] [] [GRUNTING] A little bit of infection in your wounds, perhaps.
McCLAY: Oh, yeah.
[CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] See you later, Rory.
See you in a bit.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, action.
No way.
It's a flaming Dothraki arakh.
ASBAEK: DUNNE: BANKS: Ding dong, look at that.
Is there a camera crew behind us? No.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, go.
WOMAN: Right, come on, you, down here quickly.
[LAUGHS] DRIVER: You taught me how to park the sausages.
Park your sausages, park your fucking sausages.
She teaches how to park the sausages.
That's a big fucking gap.
That's a cheap fucking sausage.
MAN [ON WALKIE]: First of the last? The first of the last get-ins of Game of Thrones.
Does that not bring a wee tear to your eye? - MAN: No.
- All right, fine, okay.
Fucking bastard.
Not like I haven't fucking stood there wasting my life, waiting on you fucking getting to your fucking unit base - [LAUGHING] - for the past seven years.
I'm going to be crying next year because I'm unemployed.
[BOTH LAUGH] [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Thank you very much.
SARAH: Today we're doing crypt wights.
These wights are mummified.
We're a bit nervous about today because it's the first time we've done this style of wight.
FINLAY: What are you nervous about? Uh, that everybody likes them.
[CHUCKLES] They're doing a proper lighting test.
I don't know.
FINLAY: I do believe so.
SARAH: And David and Dan are coming.
FINLAY: Dave and Dan are here, so they will, most likely, be popping in, I imagine.
FINLAY: So did you just set up and pitch to Game of Thrones? - Did they come and offer you? - No.
SARAH: No, what happened was Barrie's always worked for other prosthetic artists.
- FINLAY: Okay.
- SARAH: I'd done visual effects.
Barrie said, "I think they're interested in a few people quoting on Game of Thrones.
" And so Barrie and I were like: "Let's see what happens.
" You know, da-da-da.
We did our little spreadsheet, and working everything out.
Then Barrie got the phone call to say that we'd won it, and we shat ourselves.
We didn't have a workshop.
We didn't have crew.
We didn't even have tables.
We had nothing.
FINLAY: Okay.
[PHONE RINGING] Hey, Leigh.
- LEIGH: Hey.
- Hey.
We just had, um, Leigh Maddern over here to try the stump, for Leigh, the stuntman, uh, for the severed For the severed arm.
And do you remember David Nutter said they'd make sure that the character would have their sleeves rolled up.
So the issue is Leigh says the characters are wearing long-sleeved, thick jackets, which means that really you can't do a severed arm gag 'cause it'll look stupid.
You know, that's the gag, you're like [SCREAMING] Can you scratch my nose? SARAH: All we've got to do is try on the jacket make sure I can pull the sleeve up.
If I can pull the sleeve up, its happy days, - if I can't, we'll rethink.
- Not happy days.
[LAUGHING] Then have a rethink.
They'll say it's more important to go for the crypt.
If you cut through there and there, it's never going to go through A sword would never.
It would never.
Oh, that might be all right.
MAN: It seems horribly convenient he's got his sleeves rolled up ready to have his arm chopped off.
SARAH: I feel like he could have a few gold chains or something.
If they're all having their pints Hey! Aah! Ha-ha-ha.
Thank you for doing that.
Do you know how I get to Cell 4? MAN: Oh, um SARAH: Down there? MAN: Right through there, take a left.
- Yeah.
- It's right outside.
SARAH: Okay, thank you.
Don't follow me getting lost.
[SOFTLY] Shit.
Damn it.
Cell 2.
It's hard when you work so hard on something and you want everyone to like it, so I'm hoping they'll be like, "Yeah, you nailed it! High-five!" [LAUGHS] Has anyone said anything? - BARRIE: Nobody's seen anything.
- SARAH: Nobody's seen anything.
- BARRIE: No.
- SARAH: I'm excited for these.
I really hope everyone's gonna like them.
BARRIE [WHISPERS]: I think Dave and Dan are about to come.
MAN 1: Yeah, come on ahead, come on ahead.
SARAH: I can't really tell what they think.
I wanted a big round of applause.
I can't really tell what they think.
MAN 2: SARAH: In terms of the makeup, I think they're happy.
But, um, they're gonna send the pictures to Miguel, Miguel's gonna make notes, go through them with David and Dan.
We're going to have a meeting tomorrow to run through all library and crypt, so, you know.
But it wasn't a disaster.
[] Today's final.
Ha, ha.
Ta-da! [MACHINERY BEEPING] REID: Just little squirts every now and again for bits that needs to go over.
SAPOCHNIK: The way this battle is gonna work is this show has been about that people don't get on.
Now they finally find a way to get on.
You got the North with the wildlings.
So they all come together and then somebody fucks up.
REID: Fucking gloves have shrunk.
You, Jack and Glen go in and see sweet cheeks and do the dressing in there, ready for the first shot.
REID: I think it's mainly that bit back there.
Yeah, that's the bit I can see.
It's definitely tire tracks and that, car tracks.
I think that'll do it, then, I don't think they'll see much further than that.
SAPOCHNIK [ON MEGAPHONE]: All you guys that made it, you're going to survive to the big battle.
Except the 10 guys in the back are gonna die.
[ALL CHUCKLE] SAPOCHNIK: We're going to do a lot of running tonight.
REID: Just a bit of blue roll, please.
[SAPOCHNIK SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Just a little bit.
One sheet, one sheet.
Don't waste it.
SAPOCHNIK: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, action.
MAN: Go have a look at the lasagna, see what it looks like.
If it looks a bit skanky, I'll have the chicken.
Or maybe just have both and take some home for fucking dinner.
[MACHINERY BEEPING] SAPOCHNIK: I think one of the things to take into this Let's do the whole scene as if you both got stomachache.
- TURNER: Okay.
- WILLIAMS: Mm-hm.
TURNER: Okay.
Because also, is this the first time you've seen a wight, as well? This is the first time - I'm seeing them.
- Yeah.
We've been prepping and prepping but really we don't know shit.
I think the whole point, though, of this is it's not about You can't see them.
- It's the suspense of it.
- Yeah.
I think so.
That's what it is.
That's what I'm saying, the stomachache, it's uncomfortable because you can't see.
You don't have the information.
- Yeah.
- SAPOCHNIK: Let's do it again up to that point.
Then we'll work through the next section.
Set, and action.
And the dragons pass over you.
And off they go.
And they bank left, they get further and further away.
That light's slowly disappearing.
And now there are none.
But what you can hear is a very, very low rumble.
[RUMBLING] SAPOCHNIK: Episode 3 is a battle from start to finish and has three dialogue scenes in it, and that's it.
Like, if you took Battle of the Bastards into Hardhome to the Loot Train, if you put all those three together that's probably the size of this episode.
I feel tired and cold, really not particularly in the mood to go and do a long 11 weeks of night shoots.
I don't really want to spend 55 nights up.
Uh, it's David and Dan's fault, mainly.
Basically.
'Cause they wanted to do something bigger.
FINLAY: Was today a good day? Yeah, I think so.
Probably.
I mean, we finished it on time and didn't fuck it up.
[] [MACHINERY BEEPING] [FURDIK IMITATES BLOWS LANDING] Acting, acting, acting, and with the last one, you need to be already, on your position.
One, two, three.
Good.
One hit, hit, drop, pull.
- [IMITATES SWORD RINGING] - Big smash.
Okay, good.
[GRUNTS] FURDIK: Now I'm in the front line, so I'm like, "Wow, what I'm doing here?" Why? Why me? [SONG PLAYING OVER RADIO] [SINGING ALONG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] FURDIK: I grow up in Czechoslovakia.
After the revolution, many of my friends became part of the bad boy.
I was 14, 15, and I had decision.
Go with them to be gangster, or be with a live show.
So when I decided to stay with the show, it was good because many of my friends are dead already.
[] The mask completely changes you.
You're stepping in the makeup trailer joking, you know, and happy, and step-by-step, you're becoming the dark side.
He called me and he asked me if I would like to be Night King.
And I don't heard Night King, I heard just king.
And I said, "I can be any king.
" You know.
Don't worry.
I think he's angry.
He don't want to be Night King.
The Children of the Forest, they changed him, and now he's, "Okay, you want me to be Night King? Okay.
Now I kill you.
" My name is Aberdale Strongbeard.
Uh, I have fought for Stannis Baratheon.
I've also fought for, uh, Jon Snow, and that's where I currently find myself, as part of Jon Snow's Stark army.
I've been taking out the undead, you know, thinning them out before they actually reach Winterfell.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: I don't want to be on the Night Watch, I'm in House Stark, thank you very much.
I'm not a thief, I'm not a rapist, okay? It's just Watch now.
I'm not even a second son of a lord who wants honor up on the Wall.
I'm a man of House Stark, that's what I am.
I don't want to be a Frey.
No way Frey.
I don't want to be a Lannister.
I don't want to be a Bolton.
House Stark.
Absolutely has to be them.
- FINLAY: Why? - Why? Um, the direwolfs are just cool, Eddard Stark, fighting for Eddard, revenge.
Mad about Jon Snow, my favorite character.
The armor's cool.
Winterfell's class.
It's just, like, the main family in the story.
I was standing up at Magheramorne Quarry Season 6, and I had just met Gerald.
And then we're just chatting, and then the next thing here comes Kit Harington on a horse and Kit Harington's like, "Oh, hello, Gerald.
" Just like that.
And they just start talking like they're friends.
And then Kit goes off on the horse, and I'm just like [ALL LAUGH] - MAN: Let's move, boys.
- All right.
We're out of here.
And on six, five, four, three, two, one, at the end you guys get back up again.
I'm kind of doing the general I can get them with no arms.
That's fair.
[WOMAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Go, go, go.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Five, four, three, two, one.
- Fire! One, two, three, four - [ALL SNARLING] five, six, seven, eight.
MAN: I want the episode.
- McCLAY: 2019, man.
- MAN: I fucking want it.
McCLAY: It'll be the longest we'll have to wait to watch it too.
You know what I mean? From being here to watching it on-screen.
- MAN: Are you not loving this? - McCLAY: Yeah.
It's kick ass.
MAN: We're stood in the middle of Winterfell.
Take it in.
Drink it in.
[] Magnified, sanctified Be thy holy name Vilified, crucified In the human frame MAN [ON PA]: And action.
A million candles burning For the help That never came You want it darker [CHOIR VOCALIZING] Hineni, hineni I'm ready, my Lord [CHOIR VOCALIZING] There's a lover In the story But the story's Still the same There's a lullaby For suffering And a paradox to blame But it's written In the scriptures And it's not Some idle claim You want it darker MAN: Three, two, one.
We kill the flame MAN: Action.
[ALL GRUNTING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] SARAH: The big heavy makeup is quite hard work, the last couple days some of us have been doing like 18-hour days.
- WOMAN: Is he heavy? - SARAH: It is a heavy wound, even if it doesn't say heavy wounds.
Yeah, so next round, all heavy wounds.
Did we order you some gloopy blood? Was this for you? Was it turned things with dark scabs? Well, they're nice and cold.
See if you can take them all.
See if we can get all of them.
Amazing.
- [LOTTIE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] - [SARAH LAUGHS] Just talking to somebody, Lottie.
We've moved to a different location now, we're somewhere else.
You had to do the homework that they gave you? - Yeah, that was the same one.
- SARAH: Oh.
LOTTIE: Look, this is some of our Easter stuff.
Oh, she's showing things she shouldn't be showing.
- [LAUGHS] - GRANDMA: They were hidden.
- They were hidden.
- GRANDMA: For Easter.
Lottie, you found them.
That wasn't a very good hiding place, Nana.
Was it? LOTTIE: Yeah Don't do that, Lottie.
All right, then, poppet.
I'll speak to you again tomorrow.
All right, do some good swimming, yeah? GRANDMA: We'll do some reading now.
You're gonna go do some reading, and you'll practice your spellings.
All right, then, poppet.
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.
- LOTTIE: Bye.
- All right, then.
- LOTTIE [GOOFILY]: Uh Uh - [LAUGHS] All right, then, sweet.
Love you.
LOTTIE: Uh Bye.
That's it.
Funny little thing.
I think it's unfortunate that both her parents are here, so she hasn't even got one of us at home.
This was never the plan, so I'm just gonna go see where that stunt person is.
[] [DOOR OPENS] BANKS: Morning.
I have to travel with them in my hand luggage, like my little pets.
Wallet, your passport, and your wig.
[LAUGHS] Today's scene, she's a lot tidier.
'Cause she hasn't been on the dragon yet.
It will be a little bit more I'll need to be a little bit more on it.
When you've got a long wig, you're busy all day because it all gets fuzzy, and I'm constantly like, "Ah, hair.
" - WOMAN: Good morning.
Hi.
- HARINGTON: How are you doing? I'm just going to do my vocal warm-up I do every morning.
Jon Snow, Jon Snow, Jon J Jon Snow.
- [BANKS LAUGHING] - Jon Snow.
I left the curtains open when I was stark bollock the other day.
Yesterday.
I got out of the shower, and a fucking drone just drove by.
[ALL LAUGHING] I was like, there's no privacy anymore, is there? CLARKE: That's amazing.
HARINGTON: We came here first in our second season, and since then I've felt very attached to this place, and it feels like Thrones.
Woodward, hello darling.
I'm good, yes.
You okay? CAULFIELD: When I first came onboard, Chris sent me a picture of Iceland.
I saw that picture, and I said: "Yeah, that's what we need.
" I pitched it to HBO, so little was known about how short the days were, how risky it was, nobody questioned it.
It's such a magical place.
When that sun rises, it's like somebody slowly unwrapping a present.
Morning.
How are the bones? MAN: Start walking around.
All right.
[GROANS] JON: I don't know how to ride a dragon.
DAENERYS: Nobody does.
Until they ride a dragon.
NUTTER: No, really get in.
Really get in for the nose.
I could do with this amount of snow around me all the time.
- [LAUGHS] - Seriously.
MAN: Everybody back, please.
Guys, let's clear the eye lines.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
I'm the only one that's allowed to shout around here.
BANKS: It's not looking quite as tidy as it once did.
I should split.
[SIGHS] Bloody hair's just moved again.
MAN: Do you have an opinion on the hand warmers? Cam left, pan out.
MAN: Snow.
HARINGTON: Snow.
Snow.
Jon Snow in snow.
Ha-ha-ha.
Ready, and, action.
Move to your right little bit, Emilia.
And growl.
One more kiss, a little bit more, and Emilia go a bit more to your right, kissing and moving around, and still.
Growl.
One more, ready? Growl.
I think we got it.
Check the plate.
Good.
MAN: Moving on.
CAULFIELD: In our hearts, it was important for us to come here.
It wouldn't have felt the same if we didn't.
It just makes my heart really smile.
[] [] DJ 1: Nine minutes to 7.
The so-called beast from the east is making its presence felt in both Britain and Ireland.
DJ 2: Ireland under the highest weather warning, with the worst snow seen for 35 years.
DJ 1: Four hundred and forty schools will be closed today.
People have been told to stay indoors.
MAN: I need to get back here by 10.
That's all because we can't open the doors anymore.
- FINLAY: What? - We should In usual circumstances, we would just take that straight out.
Um We're so, so tight now, in terms of time, that something like, you know, this sort of poor weather makes this a bigger deal for us than it should.
FINLAY: Is this a harder season than others? - MAN: By a long shot.
- RILEY: By a long way.
The schedule is impossible.
And The season is very big.
It's written very big, um, but we have It's just all this business of trying to do, you know, film finishes on a TV schedule, and on a TV deadline.
And, um And I think this season, we've certainly found the limit of what's able to be achieved.
And, um And insofar as I think, now everybody, um, realizes that Game of Thrones has to finish because it just cannot get any bigger.
You know, there are a lot of frayed nerves walking around, um, myself being one of them.
[] LISTON: We're still totally, 100 percent frozen over at Tomb.
No, I mean, yesterday we had 250 extras, and all the crew and not one toilet.
In the bowls, the bleach was frozen.
MAN [ON WALKIE]: That's wild.
Oh, it was the icicles hanging off the taps that I couldn't believe.
You try and preempt as much as you can, but sometimes it just gets to a stage where, you know, you just can't hold mother nature back anymore.
REID: I mean, it's starting to snow again now so, you know, it's one of them, "I can't really say "that we're gonna do work until I know we can do some work.
" Is that a good enough answer for you? [LAUGHS] I can't really say anything else, 'cause it's snowing.
And if it snows, well, we can't just dress on top of real snow.
Cheers.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
Bye.
It was not a good idea to have been doing it in the winter.
You needed to have spread the snow locations out, because we can't do that many at one time.
Look at all this nonsense, it just keeps coming through all the time.
It's like, okay, like I've got time to keep pulling my phone out of my pocket.
Zigzag road, they made us put up a horizon the night before, came in in the morning ready to shoot "Can you take that down?" So that's half a day of mine wasted.
So, what we're doing, we're getting this snow up, so we can take it up to Magheramorne, the battlefield.
You know, we're just under the cost.
Ah, shit.
The wind's blowing a good one here.
REID: You, Dicky, you up at Magheramorne? There is no water at all.
Nightmare.
All right, mate.
Tara, tara.
It's all frozen up at Magheramorne.
Now I have to sort out a pump and pump it out the lake and, ugh! Fucking hell.
FINLAY: How's it going, Del? REID: It is all going.
I just feel like crying.
This car's got no bollocks.
This Fiesta, stupid little thing.
[IMITATES ENGINE] [LAUGHS] You know, it's difficult to find people who know the job, and it's not rocket science.
I mean, you could do it, Jeanie.
It ain't hard.
[HONKS] Welcome to hell, George.
Welcome to hell.
I'm not one for listening to people whinge.
I just think, "Oh, come on.
" I was brought up in children's homes.
You know, I didn't have a clue where me mom and dad was.
I left the homes when I was 16-and-a-half.
They give you 300 quid, your bloody birth certificate, and all right, get yourself out there.
[CHUCKLES] It's just, "Hm.
Okay, then.
" So, yeah, that opened my eyes.
As I've progressed, you know, I've always got more money and I just think, "To keep that, I'll have to keep working at the pace I'm working.
" You just want to do the best for your kids.
You know, I'd give up my house for my kids.
[] REID [LAUGHS]: I've never not done a set yet, but it's been very close twice.
This is the second time it's been close.
But we'll get there.
I think.
[LAUGHS] WOMAN 1: Hi.
My horses are dyed pink.
WOMAN 2: WOMAN 1: Don't even go there.
They've tried warm water, Fairy liquid, - I can't get them back to white.
- Look at the state of him.
One of them might be saying, "I'm pink.
I don't like pink.
" McCLAY: Magheramorne Quarry's been the site of the Battle of the Blackwater, Hardhome, it's also Castle Black.
This is the biggest green screen I have ever seen, but it's really impressive what they've built here.
[HORSE NEIGHS] McCLAY: This battle sequence I think we have coming up.
They don't tend to tell us a lot of stuff.
On the day, one of the ADs get up and actually tells us what's actually happening that day.
- [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - The numbers we've just heard are 120,000 wights [LAUGHING] against 18,000 um, combined in Daenerys's army and Jon Snow's army as well, like.
So we're extremely outnumbered.
I can't even begin to imagine how this is gonna look on TV.
[] McCLAY: The way I like to think of it is that the extras department is like one of the main actors.
Just as important.
I got a close-up at the Battle of the Bastards, I had no idea the camera was on me.
ASSISTANT: Rolling.
Camera set, and three, two, one [ALL GRUNTING] McCLAY: There's this collective thing we know that we're all in, trying to make this really exciting.
Because even the background tells a big story.
ASSISTANT: Great stuff, thank you.
We have cut.
MAN: March.
Left, right, left.
- Darling.
- McCRUM: Cheers, thank you.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] McCRUM: And a wee egg, sure.
Sophie, isn't it? - Yeah, Sophie, yeah.
- Nice to meet you.
- Huh? - Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
McCRUM: Sophie Ellis-Bextor, I couldn't believe it.
I'm totally starstruck.
One of my favorites from years ago.
You never get to see these people any other time, you know? But, yeah.
It's like a wee dream sometimes.
- FINLAY: They're coming to you.
- I know.
I know.
She said I was well-stocked, and I was like - [FINLAY LAUGHING] - McCRUM: Bonus.
Very busy and a bit stressful, because of the nights.
How many nights have we done so far? - Fourteen weeks, 15 weeks? - WOMAN: No, we're on our ninth.
- What? - WOMAN: Yeah.
Ninth.
- Yeah, it's only Week 9.
- It's only Week 9.
Is it really? No, it's more than that.
We started in January.
FINLAY: Is this the longest run of nights on Game of Thrones? Yes.
In fact, we were trying to think is this the longest time any film has filmed nights? I guess I could try to Google that.
What's the longest nights of any film crew? SAPOCHNIK: A smoke nightmare.
That's like smoke apocalypse.
It's almost like a bad dream.
I got to sleep at 9:30 in the morning, and I slept till 1:30.
Three hours? Is that four hours? I don't know.
One of my best-ever anxiety dreams.
It was a beautiful blue sky, and there was a rope strung across my vision and it just got pulled taut, taut, taut, taut.
Then it snapped, and I woke up.
[CHUCKLES] MAN: SAPOCHNIK: I don't fucking know.
Sounds like anxiety to me.
Background and stunts, until the moment we yell cut, you need to hold your breath, but also not breathe out.
It's gonna be amazing.
If anybody dies, let me know.
CAULFIELD: How are you doing? How are you feeling? - Good time, yeah.
- Yeah? Were you a little sore? A little sore.
Just the muscles ached, yeah.
CAULFIELD: It just gets old, these nights.
Yes, sir.
Um, so, this In this, you're dead.
GLEN: Dead.
CAULFIELD: He dies? GLEN [CHUCKLES]: The ending makes sense.
- CAULFIELD: Yes.
- Everything that's gone before.
Certainly the way they're shooting it.
CAULFIELD: That he'd die for her.
GLEN: And I think that's a big part - of her demise.
- CAULFIELD: Yes.
SAPOCHNIK: Ready, and action.
[SOBBING] [] SAPOCHNIK: Cut.
ASSISTANT: Good for 8, marker.
CAULFIELD: I can feel the weariness setting in.
Tonight Candy said, "Oh, only 14 weeks until we wrap.
" And that made it sound like, "What? No.
" I mean, it's a mixed thing.
One way, you're wishing it away, like, "Oh, please, let's get through this, this and this.
" And then the other one is like, "No, I don't want this to end.
" [] [MACHINERY BEEPING] [WHIRRING] HILL: This is a Godswood tree.
Um, I think it's a magical sort of tree.
It goes back, way back in time, and Children of the Forest They do the Children of the Forest, and they put a wee face on the front of it there.
Um Phew.
But to be honest with you I don't really know.
FINLAY: Have you done the Godswood before? HILL: I do it every year.
It's my seventh year doing it.
FINLAY: Have you got a favorite character? I did like Stannis before he killed his daughter you know.
And I liked At the minute I actually like the Night King, you know.
I'd like to have met him.
FINLAY: You know what's going to happen? Yeah, I do.
I do.
Ha-ha-ha.
FINLAY: HILL: Yeah.
[] FURDIK: When I read this, if it was up to me, maybe it would be good when Bran will kill me.
So Arya, she will appear, I will grab her or something, maybe I will kill Arya, and Bran, he kill me.
- He will throw the knife to me.
- WOMAN: Just throw it.
And then this make Night King angry, you know? I am happy, and then, okay, he looking at me, and then I see on his eyes and body like, "Oh, Night King.
" And then I Mm okay.
Arya will kill me.
The girl kill Night King, how is this possible? FURDIK: This year I don't feel so very comfortable because I don't know where I belong.
If I'm part of the actors - or I'm part of the stuntmen.
- ASSISTANT: Action.
FURDIK: Many times the stunts are joking with me: "Hey, you're the Night King, you don't need to do nothing.
" Sometimes I thinking, "You know, is that true?" When we finish Night King stuff, I can do some fire job and falling from the stairs or some fight.
I looking forward.
Yeah, I like that.
I like that.
ASSISTANT: So cast can step off, thank you.
FINLAY: They called you a bit early, Vlad.
[LAUGHS] Classic.
- It's the movie business.
- Yeah.
- Waiting, waiting - Hurry up and wait, yep.
Hurry up Do something.
And then again wait, wait.
- Yep.
- Kill him, kill him.
[LAUGHS] Kill him.
[] SAPOCHNIK [ON PA]: And camera, three, two, one, action.
[YELLS] Instead of it being a death like that, it's just a before you even get to be surprised.
FURDIK: Got it.
SAPOCHNIK: Let's just practice dropping that knife.
Ready.
There.
Okay, that's good.
That really helps.
You should be on him all the time.
Yeah.
FURDIK: Miguel, he showed me the way.
Move from A to B.
It looks like easy, but it definitely is not so easy.
So sometimes I realize be actor is not easy to be, is better to be stuntman.
Heh.
SAPOCHNIK: Three, two, one, action.
Stab him.
Good.
Action.
Stab him.
[GRUNTING] ASSISTANT: Rolling reset, thank you.
Back to ones.
SAPOCHNIK: Ready? And three, two, one, action.
Drop.
And now turn.
Look up.
Down.
Stab him.
Action.
Action.
Three, two, one, action.
Cut.
[WOMEN VOCALIZING] SARAH: We've been doing night shoots.
I can't remember what week this is.
You wake up, quickly get showered, drive to location, shoot all day, get back on the minibus, quickly try and get some sleep, wake up.
It is like Groundhog Day.
If anybody ever says: "How's it going, Sarah?" I feel like saying [LAUGHING] I'm broken.
We feel like vampires, don't we? I mean, seriously.
Everybody's just gray, aren't they? MAN: Just run it through once, so I can see it.
SARAH: Unit call was at 8 p.
m.
, we're supposed to wrap at 6 a.
m.
We don't ever wrap early.
But there's a rumor going around that we might wrap at 3.
When people start rumors like that, it's, uh [LAUGHING] It can only get So I'm really disappointed, if we're still here at 6.
FINLAY: When does Lottie get here, to be an extra? SARAH: My mother flew her over, so that we can watch Lottie being filmed for the day.
I haven't seen her for three weeks.
And there's been all this snow.
I've really struggled this shoot, actually.
[SIGHS] It's hard.
It's hard being a mum.
You know, I missed her Mother's Day, um assembly, and I missed her Easter bonnet parade.
In the grand scheme of things, you say it's not that long, but when you're living each day, it is a long time.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: I need checks on Walkers, thank you.
MAN [ON WALKIE]: just asked we make sure we ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We're rolling away.
And action.
Cut.
Got it, lovely.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: That's a cut.
MAN [ON WALKIE]: That is a wrap, good night.
- It's a wrap! - [PEOPLE CHEERING] It's a wrap.
I hope.
It's a wrap.
MAN: Guys, thanks very much for the last few months, have an excellent Easter, enjoy yourselves, get some rest, party hard, come back fresh.
FINLAY: Do you know what you're going to do today? I think I might go and film at the Belfast The Belfast Game of Thrones show.
[LAUGHING] [] Through love I've learned three things SARAH: I love your beautiful haircut.
sorrow it brings My fair girl - FINLAY: Who is it? - LOTTIE: The Night King.
And Jon Snow.
Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh WOMAN: Lottie.
That's a very exotic name.
Some people say Start fasting Break my heart GOWER [LAUGHING]: She's, like, dragging it.
Still try and date them - Survive you - Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh [] Is this Roman, then, this thing? Throw him to the lions, that sort of thing? FINLAY: You weren't here on a previous shoot? No, no.
This is a first time for me.
Every year before, "No, you're not going to Spain.
" There was never anything to do.
MAN: It's supposed to be 'round the outside where the Unsullied are, you know.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
You boys could have done it in your spare time.
[LAUGHS] There we are, Jeanie, that's it.
I don't think it's worth doing the machine, we may as well just run it out of the bags.
In Season 7, Jaime was in King's Landing and a snowflake landed on his hand, didn't it? So that allows you then to put little bits wherever.
There isn't going to be much snow apparently, so it's just me.
Not too much, just to say that it's blown in and stayed.
Yep, that does it for me.
FINLAY: It's award-winning snow, Del.
- Does that mean anything? - REID: Yeah, it's great.
They brought the Emmys to set so everybody could have their photograph taken with them.
It's the first time I've ever had my photograph taken with the Emmy.
Not that I'd show anything, "This is my Emmy.
" I've got a certificate, we got the original We had to pay for it, but, you know, I don't mind paying for it.
You know, so, yeah.
I was part of the Emmy award-winning So, yeah.
But you don't show that, do you? It's like having a forklift license.
[LAUGHING] [] CAULFIELD: It's very hard to keep the cast quiet, because when in Spain, you must eat and drink.
They're going to be out and about, and so we brought in a few ringers.
We have The Waif coming in, because so many people think that Arya is dead and The Waif killed her.
We have Jaqen, who's also another House of Black and White character.
And we have the Night King here.
Not quite sure what he would be saying.
So they won't know what's happening.
It'll be a big surprise no matter what.
[] Jon Snow is here! GREY WORM: You are not here to speak.
I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks about our bloody history.
There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.
And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] HARINGTON: It's weird, I've come out basically as decoy.
It feels weird being here and not actually filming.
When all the Spanish fans shout Kit, they shout, "Keet! Keet!" So the rest of the cast have now dubbed me Keet.
FINLAY: Keet! HARINGTON: Keet! Keet! WOMAN: Please, please, please, please.
Hi.
[FANS CLAMORING] [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] HARINGTON: Hello.
[FANS SCREAMING] FAN: Sophie.
Sophie! Okay.
[LAUGHS] I never saw this in all of my life.
So it's like, uh like, uh [FANS SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY] Like a real star, how can you live in this life, you know? Everybody recognizes them, so.
[FANS CHEERING] Okay, we can come there and just give them a couple sign, yeah? Okay, come on.
[] I would like to see if they recognize who I am, you know? [BOTH LAUGH] [SHUSHING] Please.
You know who I am? CROWD: Yeah! Night King.
- Ah! Yes! - FAN 1: The Night King! [CROWD CHEERING AND CLAPPING] - Where is my? - FAN 2: Winter is coming! Where is my army? Yes.
FAN 3: I hope you win the war.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] FAN 4: You are the best, man.
Hey, my friends, look at this.
Look at this.
My Lord.
- Say something! - What? - Say hi.
- Hey! Game of Thr [BOTH LAUGHING] - Winter is coming! - Winter is coming! Yes! Yes! [] [FANS CHEERING] MAN [ON PA]: That was Vlad the Night King's last-ever shot on Game of Thrones.
[ALL CHEERING] [] RILEY: The best moment for us is actually just before the cameras arrive.
When we have it to ourselves for a minute.
When it's quiet, and you can feel the set has a personality of its own, and it's all dressed and ready to go.
That's when I love it.
There's some mighty doors.
MAN: Twenty-nine weeks, four days.
RILEY: Twenty-nine weeks, four days.
Not that you're counting.
Twenty-nine weeks.
RILEY: Not bad for seven months' work.
You built a city in seven months.
I honestly can say I could not have worked harder.
I really have given this everything I have.
And I love it when you see people go up and they do this, you know? The minute that the camera arrives, and the machines and lights and hundreds of people come in, they use it as they need to.
We're quite shy people, we just want to be able to do our work and leave.
I don't think the actors would even know who I am.
That suits me just fine.
MAN: Well, I'm the carpet man.
Apparently, there's some looters coming.
My scene is to frantically bring the carpets in as quickly as I can and close the shutters.
I've got the lovely maiden across the way, I'm trying to get her attention.
She's otherwise occupied.
I'm just having a little contemplative moment, enjoying the sunshine.
And then, yeah, all panic sets in.
But I'm a bit precious about my pots, you might have noticed.
I want to get them all off the balcony.
ASSISTANT [ON PA]: Hello, can everyone hear me? You have to imagine right here today that this is like alarms going off.
There are air raid sirens.
You guys are trying to get into the Red Keep, which is over there.
Welcome to King's Landing.
Let's go.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Action! ASSISTANT: Go, go, go.
[PEOPLE CLAMORING] ASSISTANT: Good job, reset.
MAN [ON PA]: Golden Company, forward march.
Left, right, left, right, left.
Halt.
That's mark.
CAULFIELD: There's one, two, three [SUCKS AIR] Oh, my God, Monday is four weeks away from the end of principal photography.
Oh, my God.
FINLAY: How are your days looking? - Are they easing? - No.
No, we're actually in probably almost I wouldn't say the toughest time, but not the way we all thought we would have our spend our golden days at Game of Thrones.
What the fuck was I thinking? Which is what I'm gonna put on my tombstone.
Morning, morning.
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please.
Listen up.
So as you all know, Sam and his team have been rigging an explosion, and when we have shade, we will blow this.
- CAULFIELD: So we can stay here, right? - - - MAN: Can you look after Building 1, yeah? You know Building 1, outside the front? Yeah? That's it then, guys.
Let's get to our stations.
MAN [ON WALKIE]: Here we go.
[EXPLOSIONS BOOMING] CAULFIELD: Holy shit.
McCRUM: We haven't had a chance to look at it yet, so we've only seen the building site so far.
It's the only place you can't wait to get over to watch all the men get burnt.
There you go, cheers.
Thank you.
Okay, what can I get you? We've only got the wee ice lollies, on the board you'll see.
You can't beat a Pear Picking Porky.
Completely cleaned out of the ice pops twice today.
I never thought I was gonna see this much heat, - feel this much heat.
- Complain about it so much.
And complain about it so much, yeah.
We like the cold.
We prefer the cold than the heat.
Thank you so much.
Free wave.
That's brilliant, you can turn them 'round and somebody's up there spinning it manically.
There's going to be projectile vomit everywhere.
I mean, you couldn't write it, could you? Let's put a big, massive Ferris wheel, and actually not tell anybody that we're putting a Ferris wheel there, you know, amongst all the discussions about the big weekend and our set over there and filming.
Oh, no, they built the fucking London Eye.
[PEOPLE CLAMORING] [SCREAMING] WOMAN: Cut there.
- MAN: Reset.
- WOMAN: Reset, please.
MAN: Reset.
McCLAY: Oh, yeah.
Do you know what club sandwich means? Do you know what club sandwich means? Chicken and lettuce under bacon, that's what that is.
- I didn't know that.
- It's an acronym? Yeah, chicken and lettuce under bacon.
- Learn something new every day.
- Boom.
Every day's a school day.
WOMAN: Rolling! MAN: We're rolling.
Quiet, everyone.
[WOMAN SCREAMING] [YELLING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] MAN: Have we got a fake head hanging around? Yep.
Any severed head will do.
Chow, why in the fuck are you wearing that Bolton jacket here? Let me see this? That's shite.
Get out of here.
[LAUGHS] How are you, man? You all right? CHOW: I'm shaking your hand.
[LAUGHING] Fucking Boltons, man.
Aye, you didn't think.
You didn't fucking think about wearing that jacket, did you? [] McCLAY: ASSISTANT: We're rolling.
McCLAY: As soon as they shout rolling, I'm preparing.
And action, I'm in Westeros.
ASSISTANT: Action! [ULULATING] McCLAY: You know, you can only push a man so far, I think.
You can only push his House so far.
It doesn't matter how good he is, you know? If their blood gets up.
It's war.
This is vengeance for the Red Wedding, for the Starks, for seven seasons of taking shit from House Lannister.
So we're landing down in force, and we're just gonna kill everybody inside the city.
Unfortunately.
For them.
[] [SCREAMING] NUTTER: For the funeral scene, it's all about blocking where everybody stands.
I work hard about preparation, because I don't like to waste people's time.
And I want to spend more time directing actors.
FINLEY: Are you this prepared in all areas of your life? No.
No, I'm not.
If you saw my apartment this morning, you'd see that, uh, that didn't get any preparation at all.
I have to have two cleaning ladies come twice a week.
It's, ah It's so awful.
It's such a mess.
I want the journey to be just as positive as the end product.
That's important.
Because what you remember is the journey.
All the pyres and get people in the foreground for us.
We'll basically do the eulogy, the speech, then all coming up to light the pyres, they look at each other, then drop down, light the pyre, cut.
We're going to match the last frame of this to the first frame of that.
Fill the frame and send it to me and David before you go.
Yeah, good.
Good morning, brother.
- How are you? - NUTTER: Good, brother.
- So you're just, you're dead.
- I'm dead.
I'm dead.
NUTTER: Everyone wants a pied piper.
Not to say that I'm the pied piper, but I definitely can fake it.
You create your own world behind the camera.
You'll take the pin out, and you're reaching down here.
As you put it into his chest, you look at his eyes, like, "You're a Stark now," right? - Yeah.
- Then you stand up.
[EXHALES] Okay.
- And then you go.
- TURNER: Okay, cool.
So just give me like a couple minutes to get into it.
- NUTTER: The way we just did it? - ASSISTANT: Could we get everybody on their marks for the reference.
NUTTER: Let's see here.
Here you go, my brother.
You're here.
A bunch of wildlings behind you.
If you guys can all meet him there NUTTER: I get pretty tired, but I get invigorated too.
I guess sometimes it's a bit of performance anxiety, where I want to do a good job so that everyone feels that, "He knows what he's doing.
" This is a dream job for a director.
After directing Seasons 2, 3, and 5, I had to step away for a couple seasons due to back issues.
And I had a couple surgeries.
So I missed it beyond belief.
And coming back now, I appreciate it so much that This show saved my life.
[] We're now going to talk about why we're here.
Everyone here, you've all lost mothers, brothers, and friends, and sisters, and wives, and everything.
So background, it's all about playing that attitude all the way through.
Okay, ready? Here we go.
My father died in a car accident when I was a year-and-a-half old, so my mother and I grew up together.
She would listen to music, and I'd sing and perform for her friends that would come over for dinner.
I wanted to be the next Barry Manilow.
In college, I realized that wasn't gonna happen for me, so I said to myself, "What else can I do?" And realized that my desire to move people emotionally, I could do it by being involved in filmmaking.
NUTTER: Action.
Spirit move me Every time I'm near you Whirling like a cyclone in my mind Baby, I love you come Come, come into my arms Let me know the wonder of all of you Could it be magic? Oh, come on, come on come on Come into my arms Oh, let me know the wonder Of all of you, all of you Baby, I want you now, now Oh, now oh, now and hold on fast Oh, could this be the magic at last? Could it be magic now? NUTTER: Now! [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] McCLAY: Mr.
David Nutter.
[CROWD CHEERS] McCLAY: The atmosphere today when we done the big group photo, that hit home.
I said goodbye to the Night's Watch.
I've known them for years.
McCLAY: We all have extras jackets, and I managed to give Kit Harington one today.
He's now trying to give me money for it, but I won't take the money, because I just want to give Jon Snow his jacket, big time.
So he'll never give me that money.
I don't want that money.
It's going to be very emotional for the actors.
I couldn't imagine what it's like for them to finally say goodbye.
[BANKS CHUCKLING] [EXCLAIMING] We're in no rush this morning.
CLARKE: No, I know.
You know what? BANKS: It's Emilia's last day, we're in no rush.
Is there any part of you that's a bit relieved? - Do you know what I mean? - BANKS: Yeah.
- Uh, yeah.
- Like, not in a: "Oh, thank fuck that's over," but as in like a, "Oh, right, that's one thing I don't need to panic about anymore.
" BANKS: I'm tired.
Tired.
BANKS: I kind of had enough just now.
- Mm.
- [CHUCKLES] - BANKS: It's that bittersweet - CLARKE: Yeah, exactly.
BANKS: Because my life's been on pause, let's unpause it and get that garden fence painted.
Exactly.
Yeah, for heaven's sake.
Put that picture on the wall, damn it.
But yeah, there's definitely an exhale of breath.
So many people involved in this.
You know, it's just people's everything.
It's kind of exciting to sort of think: "Oh, who am I without this, then?" I wonder.
Adjust.
I'm trying to remember the first time we put this on.
I saw a clip of that the other day, when you were riding on that horse through Belfast, and it was absolutely freezing.
And you were in, like, nothing but a slip.
Yeah.
No such thing as thermals back then.
[SIGHS] I'm not sure this wig's got much more life left in it.
CLARKE: Neither has the head underneath it, so Oh, it's the last time.
BANKS: It's the last time.
Oh, that's really weird.
[] Gimme the ring Kissed and told Gimme something that I missed Gimme the ring A hand to hold Wild and what it seems Gimme the ring Kill the king When love is the law Gimme the ring Gimme dream child And do you hear me call? Gimme the ring On the loan and on the level Still on the floor Gimme the ring Sing the dream child And do you hear me at all? ASSISTANT: That was Emilia's last shot on Game of Thrones.
[ALL CHEERING] BANKS: This is my idea of hell, at the moment.
I hate goodbyes anyway, I'm not good at it.
I'll try to just sneak out the back door and miss this bit out.
Hey now, hey now, now Sing "This Corrosion" to me Hey now, hey now now sing LISTON: Here's a bit of wood I could take home.
That's where we stabbed Jon Snow.
I'll never forget that one.
Well, old girl, cheerio.
Served us well.
Sleep tight.
Gimme the things That don't last long Gimme siren, child And do you hear me call? Okay.
Now I've got everything packed.
Like a healing hand Just gimme the ring [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] It's just fucking tele, isn't it? Oh So this has been really quite hard.
[LAUGHS] And, um, I think, you know, some days we've really struggled to get through it.
I think if it wasn't for you guys and your morale, that's really what has got us through.
But this is obviously a big end.
I know lots of you are going home as of the weekend, and I hope that we get other projects like this again.
BARRIE: I don't.
[ALL LAUGHING] Because I want to keep the team together.
So thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
[ALL CHEER AND CLAP] McCLAY: So it's me, you, Big Johnny.
Shane Cavanaugh's coming in too.
All right.
I heard it's only 12 people doing it.
Yeah, there's only 10 Unsullied.
McCLAY: You all right, man? There's very few of us in for this.
McCLAY: I was just told I have a feature there at the very last episode.
So Jon's honor guard, I was like, no way.
- So - FINLEY: Do you think you'll get seen on camera? Eh, because it's such a tight scene with less numbers, possibly, yeah.
Yeah.
So, um It'll be like, yeah, just point to me, "Dad, there I am.
Look again.
" And he'll be like, "Yep.
Again.
" [LAUGHS] So it would be a brilliant way to cap off the season.
2016, 2015.
I'm trying to find Andy McClay's first day.
Ah, there he is.
This is the first makeup look.
I was like, you'll never get a part if you look like that.
You'll have to change your expression.
And then we got Andy McClay.
Cold Andy.
It's as if it's Day 1.
You came in and you told me that your house had just burnt down.
Oh, yeah, the fire in the house.
I was like, and you're here for a makeup test? Had a fire in the house.
You weren't late either.
No, I wasn't late.
This is the thing, man.
Escape from the reality.
[CHUCKLES] - Right.
- Look there, now.
Argh.
- And shoot.
- Sorted.
SMYTH: Off you pop, off you pop.
Goodbye, Andy.
McCLAY: This is sinking in now, that it's my last day.
Just back to normal life now, after this.
Good morning, how are you? Nice to see you.
Kit, all right, man.
HARINGTON: Ah, nice one, man.
Nice one, man.
Do you want a Season 8 one? A Targaryen dragon man with a direwolf head in the middle of it, that's what we're getting for Season 8.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? I can get you one of them if you want one.
Yeah, man.
Yeah.
Some detail.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sweet, man.
- Nice, man.
- See ya.
Sweet, eh? - I know, man.
I know.
- Last day.
Aw, what? [LAUGHS] In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die.
Grey Worm.
McCLAY: Grey Worm, he's totally gone, and of course Jon's trying to save lives, so him and Grey Worm have a standoff there.
I think that the Starks in the background are in a very precarious situation, because we hate Lannisters.
We don't care if they die.
But it's our king's command.
If the Unsullied are pointing their spears at him we're not happy with that.
DAVOS: Easy.
MAN: Set.
Three, two, one, Action.
MAN: Cut.
ASSISTANT: Okay, cut there.
[EXHALES] So with that, that is a Game of Thrones wrap on our good friend Jacob Anderson, Liam Cunningham, and Kit Harington.
CROWD: Keet! Keet! WEISS: Ten years ago you walked in to Nina Gold's office, as a 12-year-old [ALL LAUGH] And here we are now.
Your watch has ended.
And it has been a hell of a watch.
For us, for these people, and for so many people around the world.
Thank you for being Jon Snow, and thank you more than that for being you.
[ALL CLAPPING] HARINGTON: I feel like my heart is breaking.
I love this show.
[CRYING] More than, I think, anything.
It has never been a job for me.
It's been my life, and this will always be the greatest thing I'll ever do and be a part of, and you have been just my family.
I love you for it, and thank you so much.
[ALL CLAPPING] ASSISTANT Reset, please.
MAN: McCLAY [SIGHS]: Thanks, man.
[CLEARS THROAT] I'm choking up here, man.
Honestly.
Um It's what Kit was saying.
Um Even though I'm just an extra in comparison to him being the main star, um, it has It really has changed my life.
[SNIFFLES] The show I didn't think I was going to get this emotional.
It has, it really has.
The past five years has been the best five years It's been the best five years of my life.
So, um, I will miss it.
But it's always something that I'll be able to look back on.
[CLEARS THROAT] So absolutely brilliant.
It's just It's hard to fathom that I'll never be coming back to Game of Thrones.
MAN: All background back to TEC.
Going this way.
McCLAY: Best thing I've ever done.
There are four white walls In every damn hotel A light by the bed Stains on the floor And it's here I will wait out the storm CAULFIELD: It's hard saying goodbye to everybody.
There's too many people that you just want to talk to and say how much you love them and thank them, and you just can't.
I think that I was able to, I don't know, to bring my philosophy of, you know, love and camaraderie and family to the show.
You know, that's the way I just always treat everybody.
CAULFIELD: If people have Game of Thrones on their credits, people know that person had to work really hard, that person knew what they were doing, that person created, you know, a magical world.
[SIGHS] There are red velvet seats In the windowless rooms A curtain to draw And faces to please And it's here I will wait out the storm Killing time on the fringes again Before the leaving Before the leaving McCLAY: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Game of Thrones tours.
What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.
So guys, you're very welcome to Game of Thrones tours.
I'm gonna talk to you about this.
This is Carrick Castle.
Guys, Carrick Castle is not in Game of Thrones, so we're just going to fucking drive on past Carrick Castle.
I'm going to take you to Stannis's camp, what we're going to see is all the lads laying low for their gruel, then who's going to pop on? It's Ser Davos Seaworth, Hand of the King to Stannis Baratheon.
Easing himself onto camera, that's me right there.
- [SHIVERING] - [ALL LAUGHING] Wasn't even cold that day on set.
Acting, is what we call this.
Yeah? All right.
Here we come, we're coming around the corner and we're gonna see Irish mists.
And we're coming up here now, just around this bend.
Castle Black, ladies and gentlemen.
I guarantee that it's up there.
If you could see it, well done to you.
This American guy said to me, he said: [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] "Hey.
Hey, buddy.
" [NORMALLY] And I'm like, "Yeah, what's up, man?" [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] He said, "How did the Troubles start? Tell me, how did the Troubles start?" [NORMALLY] I was like, "Well, mate, the Troubles first started when Jaime Lannister pushed Bran Stark out the window.
